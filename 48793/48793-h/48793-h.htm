<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he present volume is not a record of original work, nor
is it a text-book for the laboratory. Theoretical and
practical text-books of Bacteriology plentifully exist both in
England and America. There are two large works widely
used, one by Professor Crookshank, entitled <cite>Bacteriology and
Infective Diseases</cite>, the other by Dr. Sternberg, <cite>A Manual of
Bacteriology</cite>. There are also, in English, a number of smaller
works by Abbott, Ball, Hewlett, Klein, Macfarland, Muir
and Ritchie, and Sims Woodhead. This book is of a less
technical nature. It is an attempt, in response to the editor
of the series, to set forth a popular scientific statement of our
present knowledge of bacteria. Popular science is a somewhat
dangerous quantity with which to deal. On the one
hand it may become too popular, on the other too technical.
It is difficult to escape the Scylla and Charybdis in such
a voyage.</p>

<p>I am much indebted to Professor Crookshank, who, in
reading the manuscript, has helped me by many valuable
criticisms. My thanks are also due to Sir C. T. D. Acland,
Bart., for many kind suggestions, and to Mr. E. J. Spitta,
M.R.C.S., who has been good enough to take a number of
excellent photo-micrographs for me. Some other illustrations
have been derived from the <cite>Atlas of Bacteriology</cite>, brought out
jointly by Messrs. Slater and Spitta. For these also I am
glad to have an opportunity of expressing my thanks. It
should be understood that the outline drawings are only of
a diagrammatic nature.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>e live in a world that is teeming with life. From the
earliest times of man that life has been studied and
the observations recorded. Thus there has slowly come to
be a considerable accumulation of knowledge concerning the
various forms (morphology) and functions (physiology) of
organised life. This we call the science of biology. It has
for its object the study of organic beings, and for its end the
knowledge of the laws of their organisation and activity.
Slowly, too, in the midst of this gradual accumulation of
facts, we begin to see incoherence becoming coherent, chaos
becoming cosmos, chance and accident becoming law.
Further, the contemplation and comprehension which built
up the edifice of modern biology is assuming a new relationship
to practical life. Biology can no longer be considered
only as an academic occupation or as a theoretical pabulum
upon which the leisured mind may ruminate. With rapid
strides and determined face this giant of knowledge has
marched into the arena of practical politics. The world is
opening its eyes to a reality which it had mistaken for a vision.</p>

<p>This application of biology to life and its problems has in
recent years been nowhere more marked than in the realm
of bacteriology. This comparatively new science, associated
with the great names of Pasteur, Koch, and Lister, furnishes
indeed a stock illustration of the applicability of pure biology.
Turn where we will, we shall find the work of the unseen
hosts of bacteria daily claiming more and more attention
from practical people. Thus biology, even when clothed in
the form of microscopic cells, is coming to occupy a new
place in the minds of men. "Its evolution," as Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>
Patrick Geddes declares, "forms part of the general social
evolution." Certainly its recent rapid development forms a
remarkable feature in the practical science of our time. Not
only in the diagnosis and treatment of disease, nor even in
the various applications of preventive medicine, but in ever-increasing
degree and sphere, micro-organisms are recognised
as agents of utility or otherwise no longer to be ignored.
They occur in our drinking water, in our milk supply, in the
air we breathe. They ripen cream, and flavour butter. They
purify sewage, and remove waste organic products from the
land. They are the active agents in a dozen industrial
fermentations. They assist in the fixation of free nitrogen,
and they build up assimilable compounds. Their activity
assumes innumerable phases and occupies many spheres,
more frequently proving themselves beneficial than injurious.
They are both economic and industrious in the best biological
sense of the terms.</p>

<p>Yet bacteriology has its limitations. It is well to recognise
this, for the new science has in some measure suffered in the
past from over-zealous friends. It cannot achieve everything
demanded of it, nor can it furnish a cause for every disease.
It is a science fuller of hope than proved and tested knowledge.
We are as yet only upon the threshold of the matter.
As in the neighbouring realm of chemistry, it is to be feared
that bacteriology has not been without its alchemy. The
interpretations and conclusions which have been drawn from
time to time respecting bacteriological work have led to
alarmist views which have not, by later investigation, been
fully supported. Again, the science has had devotees who
have fondly believed, like the alchemists, that the twin secret
of transmuting the baser metals into gold and of indefinitely
prolonging human life was at last to be known. But neither
the worst fears of the alarmist nor the most sanguine hopes
of the alchemist have been verified. Science, fortunately,
does not progress at such speed, or with such kindly accom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>modation.
It holds many things in its hands, but not finally
life or death. It has not yet brought to light either "the
philosopher's stone" or "the vital essence."</p>

<p>What has already been said affords ample reason for a
wider dissemination of the elementary facts of bacteriological
science. But there are other reasons of a more practical
nature. Municipalities are expending public moneys in
water analysis, in the examination of milk, in the inspection
of cows and dairies, in the bacterial treatment of sewage, and
in disinfection and other branches of public health administration.
Again, the newly formed National Association
for the Prevention of Tuberculosis, our increasing colonial
possessions with their tropical diseases, even medical science
itself, which is year by year becoming more preventive, make
an increasing claim upon public opinion. The successful
accomplishment and solution of these questions depend in
a measure upon an educated public opinion respecting the
elements of bacteriology. Recently it was urged that "the
first elements of bacteriology should be shadowed forth in
the primary school."<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> This course was advised owing to such
knowledge being of value to those engaged in dairying. As
we shall point out at a later stage, many of the undesirable
changes occurring in milk are due to bacteria, even as the
success of the butter and cheese industries depends on the
use and control of the fermentative processes due to their
action. Much of the uncertainty attending the manufacture
of dairy products can only be abolished by the careful
application of some knowledge of the flora of milk. In
Denmark and in Scandinavia the importance of such
knowledge is realised and acted upon. America, too, has
not been slow to respond to these needs; but in England
comparatively little has been done in this direction.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span></p>

<p>Whilst there can be no doubt as to the advantage of a
wider dissemination of the ascertained facts concerning
bacteria, it should be borne in mind that only patient, skilled
observation and experimental research in well-equipped
laboratories can advance this branch of science, or indeed
train bacteriologists. The lives of Darwin and of Pasteur
adequately illustrate this truth. Yet it is observable that
States and public bodies are slow to act upon it, and frequently
in the past the most useful and substantial support
for the advancement of science has been forthcoming only
from private sources. As the world learns its intimate
relation to science and the interdependence between its life
and scientific truth, it may be expected more heartily to
support science.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br /></h2>

<h3><small><em>THE BIOLOGY OF BACTERIA</em><a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></small></h3>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he first scientist who demonstrated the existence of
micro-organisms was Antony von Leeuwenhoek. He
was born at Delft, in Holland, in 1632, and enthusiastically
pursued microscopy with primitive instruments. He corroborated
Harvey's discovery of the circulation of the blood in
the web of a frog's foot; he defined the red blood corpuscles
of vertebrates, the fibres of the lens of the human eye, the
scales of the skin, and the structure of hair. He was neither
educated nor trained in science, but in the leisure time of his
occupation as a linen-draper he learned the art of grinding
lenses, in which he became so proficient that he was able to
construct a microscope of greater power than had been
previously manufactured. The compound microscope dates
from 1590, and when Leeuwenhoek was about forty years old,
Holland had already given to the world both microscope
and telescope. Robert Hooke did for England what Hans
Janssen had done for Holland, and established the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
conclusion that Leeuwenhoek arrived at independently, viz.,
that a simple globule of glass mounted between two metal
plates and pierced with a minute aperture to allow rays of
light to pass was a contrivance which would magnify more
highly than the recognised microscopes of that day. It was
with some such instrument as this that the first micro-organisms
were observed in a drop of water. It was not
until more than a hundred years later that these "animalcules,"
as they were termed, were thought to be anything
more than accidental to any fluid or substance containing
them. Plenciz, of Vienna, was one of the first to conceive
the idea that decomposition could only take place in the
presence of some of these "animalcules." This was in the
middle of the eighteenth century. Just about a century later,
by a series of important discoveries, it was established beyond
dispute that these micro-organisms had an intimate causal
relation to fermentation, putrefaction, and infectious diseases.
Spallanzani, Pasteur, and Tyndall are the three who more
than others contributed to this discovery. Spallanzani was
an Italian, who studied at Bologna, and was in 1754
appointed to the chair of logic at Reggio. But his inclinations
led him into the realm of natural history. Amongst
other things, his attention was directed to the doctrine of
<em>spontaneous generation</em>, which had been propounded by
Needham a few years previously. In 1768 Spallanzani
became Professor of Natural History at Pavia, and whilst
there he demonstrated that if infusions of vegetable matter
were placed in flasks and hermetically sealed, and then
brought to the boiling point, no living organisms could
thereafter be detected, nor did the vegetable matter decompose.
When, however, the flasks were very slightly cracked,
and air gained admittance, then invariably both organisms
and decomposition appeared. Schwann, the founder of the
cell-theory, and Schulze, both showed that if the air gaining
access to the flask were either passed through highly heated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
tubes or drawn through strong acid the result was the same
as if no air entered at all, viz., no organisms and no decomposition.
The result of these investigations was that scientific
men began to believe that no form of life arose <em>de novo</em>
(<em>abiogenesis</em>), but had its source in previous life (<em>biogenesis</em>).
It remained to Pasteur and Tyndall to demonstrate this
beyond dispute, and to put to rout the fresh arguments for
spontaneous generation which Pouchet had advanced as late
as 1859. Pasteur collected the floating dust of the air, and
found by means of the microscope many organised particles,
which he sowed on suitable infusions, and thus obtained rich
crops of "animalcul&aelig;." He also demonstrated that these
organisms existed in different degrees in different atmospheres,
few in the pure air of the Mer de Glace, more in
the air of the plains, most in the air of towns. He further
proved that it was not necessary to insist upon hermetic
sealing or cotton filters to keep these living organisms in the
air from gaining access to a flask of infusion. If the neck of
the flask were drawn out into a long tube and turned downwards,
and then a little upwards, even though the end be left
open, no contamination gained access. Hence, if the infusion
were boiled, no putrefaction would occur. The organisms
which fell into the open end of the tube were arrested in the
condensation water in the angle of the tube; but even if that
were not so, the force of gravity acting upon them prevented
them from passing up the long arm of the tube into the neck
of the flask. A few years after Pasteur's first work on this
subject Tyndall conceived a precise method of determining
the absence or presence of dust particles in the air by passing
a beam of sunlight through a glass box before and after its
walls had been coated with glycerine. Into the floor of the
box were fixed the mouths of flasks of infusion. These
were boiled, after which they were allowed to cool, and
might then be kept for weeks or months without putrefying
or revealing the presence of germ life. Here all the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>ditions
of the infusions were natural, except that in the air
above them there was no dust.</p>

<p>The sum-total of result arising from all these investigations
was to the effect that no spontaneous generation was possible,
that the atmosphere contained unseen germs of life, that the
smallest of organisms responded to the law of gravitation and
adhered to moist surfaces, and that micro-organisms were in
some way or other the cause of putrefaction.</p>

<p>The final refutation of the hypothesis of spontaneous
generation was followed by an awakened interest in the
unseen world of micro-organic life. Investigations into
fermentation and putrefaction followed each other rapidly,
and in 1863 Davaine claimed that Pollender's bacillus of
anthrax, which was found in the blood and body tissues of
animals dead of anthrax, was the cause of that disease. From
that time to this in every department of biology bacteria have
been increasingly found to play an important part. They
cause changes in milk, and flavour butter; they decompose
animal matter, yet build up the broken-down elements into
compounds suitable for use in nature's economy; they assist
in the fixation of free nitrogen; they purify sewage; in
certain well-established cases they are the cause of specific
disease, and in many other cases they are the likely cause.
No doubt the disposal of spontaneous generation did much
to arouse interest in this branch of science. Yet it must
not be forgotten that the advance of the microscope and
bacteriological method and technique have played a large
share in this development. The sterilisation of culture fluids
by heat, the use of aniline dyes as staining agents, the introduction
of solid culture media (like gelatine and agar), and
Koch's "plate" method have all contributed not a little to
the enormous strides of bacteriology. Owing to its relation
to disease, physicians have entered keenly into the arena of
bacteriological research. Hence, from a variety of causes, it
has come about that the advance has been phenomenal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span></p>

<p>We shall now take up a number of points in the biology
of bacteria which call for early attention, and which are
mostly the outcome of comparatively recent work on the
subject.</p>

<p><em>The Place of Bacteria in Nature.</em> As we have seen, for a
considerable period of time after their first detection these
unicellular organisms were considered to be members of the
animal kingdom. As late as 1838, when Ehrenberg and
Dujardin drew up their classification, bacteria were placed
among the Infusorians. This was in part due to the powers
of motion which these observers detected in bacteria. It
is now, of course, recognised that animals have no monopoly
of motion. But what, after all, are the differences between
animals and vegetables so low down in the scale of life?
Chiefly two: there is a difference in life-history (in structure
and development), and there is a difference in diet. A plant
secures its nourishment from much simpler elements than is
the case with animals; for example, it obtains its carbon
from the carbonic acid gas in air and water. This it is
able to do, as regards the carbon, by means of the green
colouring matter known as <em>chlorophyll</em>, by the aid of which,
with sunlight, carbonic acid is decomposed in the chlorophyll
corpuscles, the oxygen passing back into the atmosphere, the
carbon being stored in the plant in the form of starch or
other organic compound. The supply of carbon in the
chlorophyll-free plants, among which are the bacteria, is
obtained by breaking up different forms of carbohydrates.
Besides albumen and peptone, they use sugar and similar
carbohydrates and glycerine as a source of carbon. Many
of them also have the capacity of using organic matters of
complex constitution by converting such into water, carbonic
acid gas, and ammonia. Their hydrogen comes from water,
their nitrogen from the soil, chiefly in the form of nitrates.
From the soil, too, they obtain other necessary salts. Now
all these substances are in an elementary condition, and as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
such plants can absorb them. Animals, on the other hand,
are only able to utilise compound food products which have
been, so to speak, prepared for them; for example, albuminoids
and proteids. They cannot directly feed upon the
elementary substances forming the diet of vegetables. This
distinction, however, did not at once clear up the difficult
matter of the classification of bacteria. It is true, they
possess motion, are free from chlorophyll, and even feed
occasionally upon products of decomposition&mdash;three physiological
characters which would ally them to the animal
kingdom. Yet by their structure and capsule of cellulose
and by their life-history and mode of growth they unmistakably
proclaim themselves to be of the vegetable
kingdom. In 1853 Cohn arrived at a conclusion to this
effect, and since that date they have become more and more
limited in classification and restricted in definition.</p>

<p>Even yet, however, we are far from a scientific classification
for bacteria. Nor is this matter for surprise. The
development in this branch of biology has been so rapid
that it has been impossible to assimilate the facts collected.
The facts themselves by their remarkable variety have not
aided classification. Names which a few years ago were
applied to individual species, like <em>Bacillus subtilis</em>, or
<em>Bacterium termo</em>, or <em>Bacillus coli</em>, are now representative,
not of individuals, but of families and groups of species.
Again, isolated characteristics of certain microbes, such as
motility, power of liquefying gelatine, size, colour, and so
forth, which at first sight might appear as likely to form a
basis for classification, are found to vary not only between
similar germs, but in the same germ. Different physical
conditions have so powerful an influence upon these microscopic
cells that their individual characters are constantly
undergoing change. For example, bacteria in old cultures
assume a different size, and often a different shape, from
younger members of precisely the same species; <i>Bacillus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
pyocyaneus</i> produces a green to olive colour on gelatine,
but a brown colour on potato; the bacillus of Tetanus is
virulently pathogenic, and yet may not act thus unless in
company with certain other micro-organisms. Hence it will
at once appear to the student of bacteriology that, though
there is great need for classification amongst the six or
seven hundred species of microbes, our present knowledge
of their life-history is not yet advanced enough to form
more than a provisional arrangement.</p>

<p>We know that bacteria are allied to moulds on the one
hand and yeasts on the other, and that they have no differentiation
into root, stem, or leaf; we know that they are
fungi (having no chlorophyll), in which no sexual reproduction
occurs, and that their mode of multiplication is by
division. From such facts as these we may build up a
classification as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <em>The Coccus.</em> This is the group of round cells. They
vary in size as regards species, and as regards the conditions,
artificial or natural, under which they have been grown.
Some are less than 1/25000 of an inch in diameter; others are
half as large again, if the word large may be used to describe
such minute objects. No regular standard can be laid down
as reliable with regard to their size. Hence the subdivisions
of the cocci are dependent not upon the individual elements
so much as upon the relation of those elements to each other.
A simple round cell of approximately the size already named
is termed a <em>micrococcus</em> (μικρος, small). Certain species of
micrococci always or almost always occur in pairs, and such
a combination is termed a <em>diplococcus</em>. Some diplococci are
united by a thin capsule, which may be made apparent by
special methods of staining; of others no limiting or uniting
membrane can be seen with the ordinary high powers of the
microscope.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> Again, one frequently finds a species which is
exactly described by saying that two micrococci are in contact
with each other, and move and act as one individual,
but otherwise show no alteration; whilst others are seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>which show a flattening of the side of each micrococcus
which is in relation to its partner. Perhaps the diplococci in
an even greater degree than the micrococci respond to external
conditions both as regards size and shape. It must
further be borne in mind that a dividing micrococcus assumes
the exact appearance of a diplococcus during the transition
stage of the fission. Hence, with the exception of several
well-marked species of diplococci, this form is somewhat
arbitrary. The third kind of micrococcus is that formed by
a number of elements in a twisted chain, named <em>streptococcus</em>
(<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στρεπτος</span>, twisted). This form is produced by cells dividing
in one axis, and remaining in contact with each other. It
occurs in a number of different species, or what are supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
by many authorities to be different species, owing to their
different effects. Morphologically all the streptococci are
similar, though a somewhat abortive attempt was once made
to divide them into two groups, according to whether they
were long chains or short. As a matter of fact, the length
of streptococci depends in some cases upon biological properties,
in others upon external treatment or the medium of
cultivation which has been used. Sometimes they occur as
straight chains of only half a dozen elements; at other times
they may contain thirty to forty elements, and twist in
various ways, even forming rosaries. The elements, too,
differ not only in size, but in shape, appearing occasionally
as oval cells united to each other at their sides. The fourth
form is constituted by the micrococci being arranged in
masses like grapes, the <em>staphylococcus</em> (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">σταφυλις</span>, a bunch of
grapes). The elements are often smaller than in the streptococcus,
and the name itself describes the arrangement.
There is no matrix and no capsule. This is the commonest
organism found in abscesses, etc. The <em>sarcina</em> is best
classified amongst the cocci, for it is composed of them, in
packets of four or multiples of four, produced by division
vertically in two planes. If the division occurs in one plane,
we have as a result small squares of round cells known as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
<em>merismopedia</em>. In both these conditions it frequently happens
that the contiguous sides of the elements of packets
become faceted or straightened against each other. It may
happen, too, particularly in the <em>sarcin&aelig;</em>, that segmentation is
not complete, and that the elements are larger than in any
other class of cocci. They stain very readily. Nearly all
the cocci are non-motile, though Brownian movement may
readily be observed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_b_010.jpg" width="250" height="174" alt="Sarcina" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Sarcina</span></p>
</div>

<p>2. <em>The Bacilli.</em> These consist of rods, having parallel
sides and being longer than they are broad. They differ in
every other respect according to species, but these two
characteristics remain to distinguish them. Many of them
are motile, others not. The ends or poles of a bacillus may
be pointed, round, or almost exactly square and blocked.
They all, or nearly all, possess a capsule. Individuals of the
same species may differ greatly, according to whether they
have been naturally or artificially grown, and pleomorphic
forms are abundant.</p>

<p>3. <em>The Spirilla.</em> This wavy thread group is divisible into
a number of different forms, to which authorities have given
special names. It is sufficient, however, to state that the two
common forms are the non-septate spiral thread (like the
<em>Spirillum Obermeier</em> of relapsing fever), which takes no other
form but a lengthened spirillum; and the spirillum which
breaks up into elements or units, each of which appears
comma-shaped (like the cholera bacillus). The degree of
curvature in the spirilla, of course, varies. They are the
least important of the lower bacteria.</p>

<p>The <em>Higher Bacteria</em> group includes more highly organised
members of the Schizomycetes. They possess filaments,
which may be branched, and almost always have septa and
a sheath. Perhaps the most marked difference from the
lower bacteria is in their reproduction. In the higher bacteria
we have what is in fact a flower&mdash;terminal fructification
by conidia. In this group of vegetables we have the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
Beggiatoa, Leptothrix, Cladothrix, and, at the top, the
Streptothrix. It has been demonstrated that <em>Streptothrix
actinomycotica</em> and <em>Streptothrix madur&aelig;</em> are the organismal
cause, respectively, of Actinomycosis and Madura-foot, two
diseases which have hitherto been obscure.</p>

<p><em>Pleomorphism.</em> This term designates an irregular development
of a species. Different media and external conditions
bring about in protoplasm as susceptible as mycoprotein a
variety of morphological phases. These may occur in succession,
and represent different stages in the life-history of
a bacterium, or they may be involution forms resulting from
a change of environment, and occurring as "faults" in the
species. In the <em>Bacillus coli</em>, <em>B. typhosus</em>, bacillus of Plague,
and <em>B. tuberculosis</em> pleomorphism undoubtedly occurs, and
is manifest in the change of shape. This is particularly
marked in old cultures of the last named. The ordinary
well-known bacillus may grow out into threads, with bulbous
endings, granular filaments, drumsticks, and diplococcal
forms. Speaking generally, the older the culture, the more
marked is the variation.</p>

<p><em>Polymorphism</em> is a term used to define the theory which
held that bacteria were one of the intermediate shapes or
forms between something lower and something higher in the
vegetable kingdom. Neither pleomorphism nor polymorphism
is fully understood, and many bacteriologists find
shelter from both in the term <em>involution form</em>. What we do
know is that the species already named, for example, take on
divers forms when placed under different conditions.</p>

<p><em>Composition.</em> From what we have seen of the diet of micro-organisms,
we shall conclude that in some form or other they
contain the elements nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen. All
three substances are combined in the <em>mycoprotein</em> or protoplasm
of which the body of the microbe consists. This is
generally homogeneous, and there is no sign of a nucleus.
It possesses a fortunate affinity for aniline dyes, and by this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
means organisms are stained for the microscope. Besides the
variable quantity of nitrogen present, mycoprotein may also
contain various mineral salts. The uniformity of the cell
protoplasm may be materially affected by disintegration and
<em>segmentation</em> due to degenerative changes. <em>Vacuoles</em> also may
appear from a like cause, which it is necessary to differentiate
from spores. Two other signs of degeneration are the appearance
of granules in the body of the cell protoplasm
known as <em>metachromatic granules</em>, owing to their different
staining propensities, and the <em>polar bodies</em> which are seen in
some species of bacteria. Surrounding the mass of mycoprotein,
we find in most organisms a capsule or membrane
composed, in part at least, of <em>cellulose</em>. This sheath plays a
protective part in several ways. During the adult stage of
life it protects the mycoprotein, and holds it together. At
the time of reproduction or degeneration it not infrequently
swells up, and forms a viscous hilum or matrix, inside which
are formed the new sheaths of the younger generation. It
may be rigid, and so maintain the normal shape of the
species, or, on the other hand, flexible, and so adapted to
rapid movement of the individual.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_b_013.jpg" width="300" height="144" alt="Normal and Pleon-Forms of the Bacillus of Tubash." />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Normal and Pleon-Forms of the Bacillus of Tubash.</span></p></div>

<p>Here, then, we have the major parts in the constitution of
a bacillus&mdash;its body, mycoprotein; its capsule, cellulose.
But, further than this, there are a number of additional dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>tinctive
characteristics as regards the contents inside the
capsule which call for mention. <em>Sulphur</em> occurs in the Beggiatoa
which thrive in sulphur springs. <em>Starch</em> is commoner
still. <em>Iron</em> as oxide or other combination is found in several
species. Many are highly coloured, though these are generally
the "innocent" bacteria, in contradistinction to the disease-producing.
A pigment has been found which is designated
<em>bacterio-purpurin</em>. According to Zopf, the colouring agents
of bacteria are the same as, or closely allied to, the colouring
matters occurring widely in nature. Migula holds that most
of the bacterial pigments are non-nitrogenous bodies. There
are a very large number of chromogenic bacteria, some of
which produce exceedingly brilliant colours. Among some
of the commoner forms possessing this character are <em>Bacillus
et micrococcus violaceus</em> (violet); <em>B. et M. aurantiacus</em>
(orange); <em>B. et M. luteus</em> (yellow); <em>M. roseus</em> (pink); many
of the <em>Sarcin&aelig;</em>; <em>B. aureus</em> (golden-yellow); <em>B. fluorescens
liquefaciens et non-liquefaciens</em> (green); <em>B. pyocyaneus</em> (green);
<em>B. prodigiosus</em> (blood-red).</p>

<p><em>Motility.</em> When a drop of water containing bacteria is
placed upon a slide, a clean cover glass superimposed, and
the specimen examined under an oil immersion lens, various
rapid movements will generally be observed. These are of
four kinds: (1) A dancing stationary motion known as
<em>Brownian movement</em>. This is molecular, and depends in
some degree upon heat and the medium of the moving
particles. It is non-progressive, and is well known in gamboge
particles. (2) An <em>undulatory</em> serpentine movement,
with apparently little advance being made. (3) A <em>rotatory</em>
movement, which in some water bacilli is very marked, and
consists of spinning round, with sometimes considerable
velocity, and maintained for some seconds or even minutes.
(4) A <em>progressive</em> darting movement, by which the bacillus
passes over some considerable distance.</p>

<p>The conditions affecting the motion of bacteria are but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
partly understood. Heating the slide or medium accelerates
all movement. A fresh supply of oxygen, or indeed the
addition of some nutrient substance, like broth, will have
the same effect. There are also the somewhat mysterious
powers by which cells possess inherent attraction or repulsion
for other cells, known as <em>positive</em> and <em>negative chemiotaxis</em>.
These powers have been observed in bacteria by Pfeiffer and
Ali-Cohen.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_b_015.jpg" width="200" height="199" alt="Bacilli, Showing Flagella" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Bacilli, Showing Flagella</span></p></div>

<p>The essential condition in the motile bacilli is the presence
of <em>flagella</em>.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> These cilia, or hairy processes, project from
the sides or from the ends of the rod, and are freely motile
and elastic. Sometimes only one or two terminal flagella
are present; in other cases, like the bacillus of typhoid
fever, five to twenty may occur all round the body of the
bacillus, varying in length and size, sometimes being of
greater length even than the bacillus itself. It is not yet
established as to whether these vibratile cilia are prolongations
of capsule only, or whether they contain something of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
the body protoplasm. Migula holds the former view, and
states that the position of flagella is constant enough for
diagnostic purposes. They are but rarely recognisable
except by means of special staining methods. <em>Micrococcus
agilis</em> (Ali-Cohen) is the only coccus which has flagella and
active motion.</p>

<p><em>Modes of Reproduction.</em> Budding, division, and spore formation
are the three chief ways in which Schizomycetes and
Saccharomycetes (yeasts) reproduce their kind. <em>Budding</em>
occurs in some kinds of yeast, and would be classified by
some authorities under spore formation, but in practice it is
so obviously a "budding" that it may be so classified. The
capsule of a large or mother cell shows a slight protrusion
outwards which is gradually enlarged into a daughter yeast
and later on becomes constricted at the neck. Eventually
it separates as an individual. The protoplasm of spores of
yeasts differs, as Hansen has pointed out, according to their
conditions of culture.</p>

<p><em>Division</em>, or fission, is the commonest method of reproduction.
It occurs transversely. A small indentation occurs
in the capsule, which appears to make its way slowly
through the whole body of the bacillus or micrococcus until
the two parts are separate, and each contained in its own
capsule. It has been pointed out already that in the incomplete
division of micrococci we observe a stage precisely
similar to a diplococcus. So also in the division of bacilli
an appearance occurs described as a diplobacillus.</p>

<p>Simple fission requires but a short period of time to be
complete. Hence multiplication is very rapid, for within
half an hour a new adult individual can be produced. It
has been estimated that at this rate one bacillus will in
twenty-four hours produce 17,000,000 similar individuals;
or, expressed in another way, Cohn calculated that in three
days, under favourable circumstances, this rate of increase
would form a mass of living organisms weighing 7300 tons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
and numbering about 4772 billions. Favourable conditions
do not occur, fortunately, to allow of such increase, which, of
course, can only be roughly estimated. But the above figures
illustrate the enormous fertility of micro-organic life. When
we remember that in some species it requires 10,000 or 15,000
fully grown bacilli placed end to end to stretch the length
of an inch, we see also how exceedingly small are the individuals
composing these unseen hosts.</p>

<p><em>Spore formation</em> may result in the production of germinating
cells inside the capsule of the bacillus, <em>endospores</em>, or of
modified individuals, <em>arthrospores</em>. The body of a bacillus,
in which sporulation is about to occur, loses its homogeneous
character and becomes granular, owing to the appearance of
globules in the protoplasm. In the course of three or four
hours the globule enlarges to fill the diameter of the rod, and
assumes a more concentrated condition than the parent cell.
At its maturity, and before its rupture of the bacillary capsule,
a spore is observed to be bright and shining, oval and
regular in shape, with concentrated contents, and frequently
causing a local expansion of the bacillus. In a number of
rods lying endwise, these local swellings produce a beaded
or varicose appearance, even simulating a streptococcus. In
the meantime the rod itself has become slightly broader
and pale. Eventually it breaks down by segmentation or
by swelling up into a gelatinous mass. The spore now
escapes and commences its individual existence. Under
favourable circumstances it will germinate. The tough capsule
gives way at one point, generally at one of the poles,
and the spore sprouts like a seed. In the space of about
one hour's time the oval refractile cell has become a new
bacillus. One spore produces by germination one bacillus.
Spores never multiply by fission, nor reproduce themselves.</p>

<p>Hueppe has stated that there are certain organisms (like
leuconostoc, and some streptococci) which reproduce by the
method of <em>arthrospores</em>. Defined shortly, this is simply an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
enlargement of one or more cell elements in the chain which
thus takes on the function of maternity. On either side of
the large coccus may be seen the smaller ones, which it is
supposed have contributed of their protoplasm to form a
mother cell. An arthrospore is said to be larger, more refractile,
and more resistant than an ordinary endospore.
Many bacteriologists of repute have declined hitherto to
definitely accept arthrospore formation as a proved fact.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Various Forms of Spore Formation and Flagella</span><br />

<small>A. Stages in formation of spore and its after development. B. Spirillum with terminal flagella.</small></p>

<p><br />It is important to note that spore formation in bacteria
must not be considered as a method of multiplication. The
general rule is undoubtedly that one bacillus produces one
spore, and one spore germinates into one bacillus. It is a reproduction,
not a multiplication. Indeed, the whole process
is of the nature of a resting stage, and is due (<em>a</em>) to the
arrival of the adult bacillus at its biological zenith, or (<em>b</em>) to
the conditions in which it finds itself being unfavourable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
to its highest vegetative growth, and so it endeavours to
perpetuate its species. Most authorities are probably of the
latter opinion, though there is not a little evidence for the
former. Exactly what conditions are favourable to sporulation
is not known. Nutriment has probably an intimate
effect upon it. The temperature must not be below 16&deg;&nbsp;C.,
nor much above 40&deg;&nbsp;C. Oxygen, as we have seen, is favourable,
if not necessary, to many species, which will in cultivation
in broth rise to the surface and lodge in the pellicle to
form their seeds. Moisture, too, is considered a necessity.</p>

<p>The position and size of the spore are of considerable use in
differential diagnosis. The terminal spore of <em>Bacillus tetani</em>
is well known. It is rarely seen at both ends of the bacillus,
and hence when poised only at one end causes the "drumstick"
appearance. In the bacillus of Quarter Evil the
spore is generally towards one end of the rod rather than
in the middle; in Malignant &OElig;dema the bacillus in the
blood grows out into long threads, and when such a thread
sporulates the spore is also near one end. The latter further
illustrates the fact that in some species the spore is of
greater diameter than the mother cell, and hence dilates
the bacillary capsule. The spores of anthrax are typical
oval endospores. When free in the field of the microscope,
spores must be distinguished from fat cells, micrococci,
starch cells, some kinds of ova, yeast cells, and other like
objects. Spores are detected frequently by their resistance
to ordinary stains and the necessity of colouring them by
special staining methods. When, however, a spore has
taken on the desired colour, it retains it with tenacity. In
addition to their shape, size, thickened capsule, and staining
characteristics, spores also resist desiccation and heat in a
much higher degree than bacilli not bearing spores. Roux
and some other eminent bacteriologists suggest that bacteria
should be classified according to their method of spore
formation.</p>

<h3><small>THE INFLUENCE OF EXTERNAL CONDITIONS ON
GROWTH OF BACTERIA</small></h3>

<p><em>Nutritive Medium.</em> In the very earliest days of the study
of micro-organisms it was observed that they mostly congregate
where there is pabulum for their nourishment.
The reason why fluids such as milk, and dead animal matter
such as a carcass, and living tissues such as a man's body
contain so many microbes is because each of these three
media is favourable to their growth. Milk affords almost
an ideal food and environment for microbes. Its temperature
and constitution frequently meet their requirements.
Dead animal matter, too, yields a rich diet for some species
(saprophytes). In the living tissues bacteria obtain not only
nutriment, but a favourable temperature and moisture. Outside
the human body it has been the endeavour of bacteriologists
to provide media as like the above as possible,
and containing many of the same elements of food. Thus
the life-history may be carried on outside the body and
under observation. By means of cover-glass preparations
for the microscope we are able to study the form, size,
motility, flagella, spore formation, and peculiarities of staining,
all of which characters aid us in determining to what
species the organism under examination belongs. By means
of artificial nutrient media we may further learn the characters
of the organism in "pure culture,"<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> its favourable
temperature, its power or otherwise of liquefaction, the curdling
milk, or of gas production, its behaviour towards
oxygen, its power of producing indol, pigment, and chemical
bodies, as well as its thermal death point and resistance to
light and disinfectants. It is well known that under artificial
cultivation an organism may be greatly modified in its
morphology and physiology, and yet its conformity to type
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>remains much more marked than any degeneration which
may occur.</p>

<p>The basis of many of these artificial media is <em>broth</em>. This
is made from good lean beef, free from fat and gristle, which
is finely minced up and extracted in sterilised water (one
pound of lean beef to every 1000 cc. of water). It is then
filtered and sterilised. It will be understood that such an
extract is acid. To provide <em>peptone beef-broth</em>, ten grains of
peptone and five grains of common salt are added to every
litre of acid beef-broth. It is rendered slightly alkaline by the
addition of sodium carbonate, and is filtered and sterilised.
<em>Glycerine-broth</em> indicates that 6 to 8 per cent. of glycerine has
been added after filtration, <em>glucose-broth</em> 1 or 2 per cent. of
grape-sugar. This latter is used for anaërobic organisms.
The use of broth as a culture medium is of great value. It
is undoubtedly our best fluid medium, and in it may not
only be kept pure cultures of bacteria which it is desired to
retain for a length of time, but in it also emulsions and mixtures
may be placed preparatory to further operations.
<em>Gelatine</em> is broth solidified by the addition of 100 grams of
best French gelatine to the litre. Its advantage is twofold:
it is transparent, and it allows manifestation of the power of
liquefaction. When we speak of a liquefying organism we
mean a germ having the power of producing a peptonising
ferment which can at the temperature of the room break
down solid gelatine into a liquid. <em>Grape-sugar gelatine</em> is
made like grape-sugar broth. <em>Agar</em> was introduced as a
medium which would not melt at 25&deg;&nbsp;C., like gelatine, but
remain solid at blood-heat (37·5&deg;&nbsp;C.; 98·5&deg;&nbsp;F.). It is a seaweed
generally obtained in dried strips from the Japanese
market. Ten to fifteen grams are added to every litre of
peptone-broth. Filtration is slow and often difficult, and
the result not as transparent as desirable. The former difficulty
is avoided by filtering in the Koch's steamer or with
a hot-water filter, the latter by the addition of the white of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
an egg. Glycerine and grape-sugar may be added as elsewhere.
<em>Blood agar</em> is ordinary agar with fresh sterile blood
smeared over its surface. <em>Blood serum</em> is drawn from a jar
of coagulated horse-blood, in which the serum has risen to
<span class="figleft100">

<small>Glycerine is

bulb of the tube</small></span></span>
the top. This is collected in sterilised tubes and
coagulated in a special apparatus (the serum inspissator).
<em>Potato</em> is prepared by scraping ordinary
potatoes, washing in corrosive sublimate, and
sterilising. They may then be cut into various
shapes convenient for cultivation. Upon any of
these forms of solid media the characteristic
growth of the organism can be observed. Of the
nutrient elements required, nitrogen is obtained
from albumens and proteids, carbon from milk-sugar,
cane-sugar, or the splitting up of proteids;
salts (particularly phosphates and salts of potassium)
are readily obtainable from those incorporated
in the media; and the water which is required is
obtainable from the moisture of the media.</p>

<p>There are two common forms of test-tube culture, viz.: on
the surface and in the depth of the medium. In the former
the medium is sloped, and the inoculating needle is drawn
along its surface; in the latter the needle is thrust vertically
downwards into the depth of the solid medium. Plate cultures
and anaërobic cultures will be described at a later
stage. When the medium has been inoculated the culture
is placed at a temperature which will be favourable. Two
standards of temperature are in use in bacteriological laboratories.
The one is called <em>room temperature</em>, and varies from
18&deg;&nbsp;C.-20&deg;&nbsp;C.; the other is <em>blood-heat</em>, and varies from 35&deg;&nbsp;C.-38&deg;&nbsp;C.
It is true, some species will grow below 18&deg;&nbsp;C.,
and others above 38&deg;&nbsp;C. The pathogenic (disease-producing)
bacteria thrive best at 37&deg;&nbsp;C., and the non-pathogenic at the
ordinary temperature of the room. The different degrees
of temperature are regulated by means of incubators. For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>the low temperatures gelatine is chosen; as a medium for the
higher temperatures agar.</p>

<p><em>Moisture</em> has been shown to have a favourable effect upon
the growth of microbes. Drying will of itself kill many
species (<em>e. g.</em>, the spirillum of cholera), and, other things being
equal, the moister a medium is, the better will be the growth
upon it. Thus it is that the growth in broth is always more
luxuriant than that on solid media. Yet the growth of
<em>Bacillus subtilis</em> and other species is an exception to this
rule, for they prefer a dry medium.</p>

<p><em>Temperature.</em> Most bacteria grow well at room temperature,
but they will grow more luxuriantly and speedily at
blood-heat. The optimum temperature is generally that of
the natural habitat of the organism. In exceptional cases
growth will occur as low as 5&deg;&nbsp;C. or as high as 70&deg;&nbsp;C.
Indeed, some have been cooled to-20&deg;&nbsp;C. and-30&deg;&nbsp;C., and
yet retained their vitality,<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> whereas some few can grow at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>60&ndash;70&deg;&nbsp;C. These latter are termed <em>thermophilic</em> bacteria.
The average thermal death-point is at or about 50&deg;&nbsp;C.</p>

<p><em>Light</em> acts as an inhibitory or even germicidal agent. This
fact was first established by Downes and Blunt in a memoir
to the Royal Society in 1877. They found by exposing
cultures to different degrees of sunlight that thus the growth
of the culture was partially or entirely prevented, being most
damaged by the direct rays of the sun, although diffuse daylight
acted prejudicially. Further, these same investigators
proved that of the rays of the spectrum which acted inimically
the blue and violet rays acted most bactericidally, next
to the blue being the red and orange-red rays. The action
of light, they explain, is due to the gradual oxidation which
is induced by the sun's rays in the presence of oxygen.
Duclaux, who worked at this question at a later date, concluded
that the degree of resistance to the bactericidal influence
of light which some bacteria possess might be due
to difference in species, difference in culture media, and
difference in the degrees of intensity of light. Tyndall tested
the growth of organisms in flasks exposed to air and light
on the Alps, and found that sunlight inhibited the growth
temporarily. A large number of experimenters in Europe
and England have worked at this fascinating subject since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>1877, and though many of their results appear contradictory,
we may be satisfied to adopt the following conclusions respecting
the matter:</p>

<p>(1) Sunlight has a deleterious effect upon bacteria, and to
a less extent on their spores.</p>

<p>(2) This inimical effect can be produced by light irrespective
of rise in temperature.</p>

<p>(3) The ultra-violet rays are the most bactericidal, and the
infra-red the least so, which indicates that the phenomenon
is due to chemical action.</p>

<p>(4) The presence of oxygen and moisture greatly increases
this action.</p>

<p>(5) The sunlight acts prejudicially upon the culture medium,
and thereby complicates the investigation and after-growth.</p>

<p>(6) The time occupied in the bactericidal action depends
upon the heat of the sun and the intrinsic vitality of the
organism.</p>

<p>(7) With regard to the action of light upon pathogenic
organisms, some results have recently been obtained with
<em>Bacillus typhosus</em>. Janowski maintains that direct sunlight
exerts a distinctly depressing effect on typhoid bacilli. At
present more cannot be said than that sunlight and fresh
air are two of the most powerful agents we possess with
which to combat pathogenic germs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 397px;">
<img src="images/i_024fp.jpg" width="397" height="603" alt="Pasteur's Large Incubator for Cultivation at Room Temperature" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Pasteur's Large Incubator for Cultivation at Room Temperature</span></p></div>

<p>A very simple method of demonstrating the influence of
light is to grow a pure culture in a favourable medium,
either in a test-tube or upon a glass plate, and then cover
the whole with black paper or cloth. A little window may
then be cut in the protective covering, and the whole exposed
to the light. Where it reaches in direct rays it will be found
that little or no growth has occurred; where, on the other
hand, the culture has been in the dark, abundant growth
occurs. In diffuse light the growth is merely somewhat inhibited.
It has been found that the electric light has but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
little action upon bacteria, though that which it has is similar
to sunlight. Recent experiments with the Röntgen rays
have given negative results.</p>

<p>In 1890 Koch stated that tubercle bacilli were killed after
an exposure to direct sunlight of from a few minutes to
several hours. The influence of diffuse light would obviously
be much less. Professor Marshall Ward has experimented
with the resistant spores of <em>Bacillus anthracis</em> by growing
these on agar plates and exposing to sunlight. From two to
six hours' exposure had a germicidal effect.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that several species of sea-water
bacteria themselves possess powers of phosphorescence.
Pflüger was the first to point out that it was such organisms
which provided the phosphorescence upon decomposing wood
or decaying fish. To what this light is due, whether capsule,
or protoplasm, or chemical product, is not yet known. The
only facts at present established are to the effect that certain
kinds of media and pabulum favour or deter phosphorescence.</p>

<p><em>Desiccation.</em> A later opportunity will occur for consideration
of the effect of drying upon bacteria. Here it is only
necessary to say that, other things being equal, drying
diminishes virulence and lessens growth.</p>

<p><em>Oxygen.</em> Pasteur was the first to lay emphasis upon the
effect which free air had upon micro-organisms. He classified
them according to whether they grew in air, <em>aërobic</em>, or
whether they flourished most without it, <em>anaërobic</em>. Some
have the faculty of growing with or without the presence of
oxygen, and are designated as <em>facultative</em> aërobes or anaërobes.
As regards the cultivation of anaërobic germs, it is
only necessary to say here that hydrogen, nitrogen, or carbonic
acid gas may be used in place of oxygen, or they may
be grown in a medium containing some substance which
will absorb the oxygen.</p>

<p><em>Modes of Bacterial Action.</em> In considering the specific
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
action of micro-organisms, it is desirable, in the first place,
to remember the two great functional divisions of saprophyte
and parasite. A <em>saprophyte</em> is an organism that obtains its
nutrition from dead organic matter. Its services, of whatever
nature, lie outside the tissues of living animals. Its life
is spent apart from a "host." A <em>parasite</em>, on the other hand,
lives always at the expense of some other organism which is
its host, in which it lives and upon which it lives. There is a
third or intermediate group, known as "facultative," owing
to their ability to act as parasites or saprophytes, as the
exigencies of their life-history may demand.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Method of Producing Hydrogen by Kipp's Apparatus for
Cultivation of Anaërobes</span> (See page <a href="#Page_139">139</a>)</p>
</div>

<p>The saprophytic organisms are, generally speaking, those
which contribute most to the benefit of man, and the parasitic
the reverse, though this statement is only approximately true.
In their relation to the processes of fermentation, decomposition,
nitrification, etc., we shall see how great and invaluable
is the work which saprophytic microbes perform. Their result
depends, in nearly all cases, upon the organic chemical
constitution of the substances upon which they are exerting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
their action, as well as upon the varieties of bacteria themselves.
Nor must it be understood that the action of saprophytes
is wholly that of breaking down and decomposition.
As a matter of fact, some of their work is, as we shall see,
of a constructive nature; but, of whichever kind it is, the
result depends upon the organism and its environment.
<span class="figleft75">
<img src="images/i_b_028.jpg" width="75" height="246" alt="Anaërobic

</span>
This, too, may be said of the pathogenic species, all of
which are in a greater or less degree parasitic. It is well
known how various are the constitutions of man,
how the bodies of some persons are more resistant
than those of others, and how the invading microbe
will find different receptions according to the constitution
and idiosyncrasy of the body which it
attacks. Indeed, even after invasion the infectivity
of the special disease, whatever it happens to be,
will be materially modified by the tissues. When
we come to turn to the micro-organisms which
are pathogenic parasites we shall further have to
keep clear in our minds that their action is double
and complex, and not single or simple. In the
first place, we have an infection of the body due
to the bacteria themselves. It may be a general
and widespread infection, as in anthrax, where the
bacilli pass, in the blood or lymph current, to
each and every part of the body; or it may be a
comparatively local one, as in diphtheria, where the invader
remains localised at the site of entrance. But, be
that as it may, the micro-organisms themselves, by their
own bodily presence, set up changes and perform functions
which may have far-reaching effects. It is obvious that
the wider the distribution the wider is the area of tissue
change, and <em>vice versâ</em>. Yet there is something of far
greater importance than the mere presence of bacteria in
human or animal tissues; for the secondary action of disease-producing
germs&mdash;and possibly it is present in all bacteria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>&mdash;is
due to their poisonous products, or <em>toxins</em>, as they
have been termed. These may be of the nature of ferments,
and they become diffused throughout the body,
whether the bacteria themselves occur locally or generally.
They may bring about very slight and even imperceptible
changes during the course of the disease, or they may kill
the patient in a few hours. Latterly bacteriologists have
come to understand that it is not so much the presence
of organisms which is injurious to man and other animals,
as it is their products which cause the mischief; and the
amount of toxic product bears no known proportion to the
degree of invasion by the bacteria. The various and widely
differing modes of action in bacteria are therefore dependent
upon these three elements: the tissues or medium, the bacteria,
and the products of the bacteria; and in all organismal
processes these three elements act and react upon each other.</p>

<p>A word may be said here respecting the much-discussed
question of <em>species</em> in bacteria. A species may be defined as
"a group of individuals which, however many characters they
share with other individuals, agree in presenting one or more
characters of a peculiar and hereditary kind with some certain
degree of distinctness."<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> Now, as regards bacteria, there is
no doubt that separate species occur and tend to remain as
separate species. It is true, there are many variations, due in
large measure to the medium in which the organisms are
growing,&mdash;variations of age, adaptation, nutrition, etc.,&mdash;yet
the different species tend to remain distinct. Involution
forms occur frequently, and degeneration invariably modifies
the normal appearance. But because of the occurrence of
these morphological and even pathological differences it must
not be argued that the demarcation of species is wholly
arbitrary.</p>

<p><em>Means of Sterilisation.</em> As this term occurs frequently in
even a book of this untechnical nature, and as it is expressive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>of an idea which must always be present to the mind of the
bacteriologist, it may be desirable to make some passing
allusion to it.</p>

<p>Chemical substances, perfect filtration, and heat are the
three means at our command in order to secure germ-free
conditions of apparatus or medium. The first two, though
theoretically admissible, are practically seldom used, the
former of the two because the addition of chemical substances
annuls or modifies the operation, the latter of the two on
account of the great practical difficulties in securing perfection.
Hence in the investigation involved in bacteriological
research heat is the common sterilising agent. A temperature
of 70&deg;&nbsp;C. (158&deg;&nbsp;F.) will kill all bacilli; even 58&deg;&nbsp;C. will
kill most kinds. Boiling at 100&deg;&nbsp;C. (212&deg;&nbsp;F.) for three minutes
will kill anthrax spores, and boiling for thirty to sixty
minutes will kill all bacilli and all spores. This difference
in the <em>thermal death-point</em> between bacilli and their
spores enables the operator to obtain what are called "pure
cultures" of a desired bacillus from its spores which may be
present. For example, if a culture contains spores of anthrax
and is contaminated with micrococci, heating to 70&deg;
C. (158&deg;&nbsp;F.) will kill all the micrococci, but will not affect the
spores of anthrax, which can then grow into a pure culture
of anthrax bacilli. <em>Fractional or discontinuous sterilisation</em>
depends on the principle of heating to the sterilising point
for bacilli (say 70&deg;C.) on one day, which will kill the bacilli,
but leave the spores uninjured. But by the following day
the spores will have germinated into bacilli, and a second
heating to 70&deg;C. will kill them before they in their turn
have had time to sporulate. Thus the whole will be sterilised,
though at a temperature below boiling.</p>

<p>Successful sterilisation, therefore, depends upon killing
both bacteria and their spores, and nothing short of that
can be considered as sterilisation. The following methods
are those generally used in the laboratory. For dry heat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
(which is never so injurious to organisms as moist heat)<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>:
(<em>a</em>) <em>the Bunsen burner</em>, in the flame of which platinum
needles, etc., are sterilised; (<em>b</em>) <em>hot-air chamber</em>, in which
flasks and test-tubes are heated to a temperature of 150&ndash;170&deg;
<span class="figright200">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Koch's Steam Steriliser</span></span></span>
C. for half an hour. For moist
heat: (<em>c</em>) <em>boiling</em>, for knives and instruments;
(<em>d</em>) <em>Koch's steam steriliser</em>,
by means of which a crate is
slung in a metal cylinder, at the
bottom of which the water is
boiled; (<em>e</em>) <em>the autoclave</em>, which is
the most rapid and effective of all
the methods. This is in reality a
Koch steriliser, but with apparatus
for obtaining high pressure. The
last two (<em>d</em>, <em>e</em>) are used for sterilising
the nutriment media upon
which bacteria are cultivated outside
the body. Blood serum
would, however, coagulate at a
temperature over 60&deg;&nbsp;C. (124&deg;&nbsp;F.),
and hence a special steriliser has
been designed to carry out fractional
sterilisation daily for a week
at about 55&deg;&nbsp;C.-58&deg;&nbsp;C.</p>

<p><em>The Association of Organisms.</em>
At a later stage we shall have an
opportunity of discussing symbiosis
and allied conditions. Here
it is only necessary to draw attention to a fact that is rapidly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>becoming of the first importance in bacteriology. When
species were first isolated in pure culture it was found that
they behaved somewhat differently under differing circumstances.
This modification in function has been attributed
to differences of environment and physical conditions.
Whilst it is true that such external conditions must have a
marked effect upon such sensitive units of protoplasm as
bacteria, it has recently been proved that one great reason
why modification occurs in pure artificial cultures is that the
species has been isolated from amongst its colleagues and
doomed to a separate existence. One of the most abstruse
problems in the immediate future of the science of bacteriology
is to learn what intrinsic characters there are in species
or individuals which act as a basis for the association of
organisms for a specific purpose. Some bacteria appear to
be unable to perform their regular function without the aid
of others. An example of such association is well illustrated
in the case of tetanus, for it has been shown that if the
bacilli and spores of tetanus alone obtain entrance to a
wound the disease may not follow the same course as when
with the specific organism the lactic-acid bacillus or the
common organisms of suppuration or putrefaction also gain
entrance. There is here evidently something gained by association.
Again, the virulence of other bacteria is also increased
by means of association. The <em>Bacillus coli</em> is an
example, for, in conjunction with other organisms, this bacillus,
although normally present in health in the alimentary
canal, is able to set up acute intestinal irritation, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>various changes in the body of an inflammatory nature. It
is not yet possible to say in what way or to what degree the
association of bacteria influences their <em>rôle</em>. That is a problem
for the future. But whilst we have examples of this association
in streptococcus and the bacillus of diphtheria, <em>B.
coli</em> and yeasts, tetanus and putrefactive bacteria, <em>Diplococcus
pneumoni&aelig;</em> and streptococcus, and association amongst
the various suppurative organisms, we cannot doubt that
there is an explanation to be found here of many hitherto
unsolved results of bacterial action. This is the place in
which mention should also be made of higher organisms associated
for a specific purpose with bacteria. There is some
evidence to support the belief that some of the Leptotriche&aelig;
(Crenothrix, Beggiatoa, Leptothrix, etc.) and the Cladotriche&aelig;
(Cladothrix) perform a preliminary disintegration of organic
matter before the decomposing bacteria commence their
labours. This occurs apparently in the self-purification of
rivers, as well as in polluted soils.</p>

<p><em>Antagonism of Bacteria.</em> Study of the life-history of
many of the water bacteria will reveal the fact that they
can live and multiply under conditions which would at once
prove fatal to other species. Some of these water organisms
can indeed increase and multiply in distilled water, whereas
it is known that other species cannot even live in distilled
water, owing to the lack of pabulum. Thus we see that
what is favourable for one species may be the reverse for
another.</p>

<p>Further, we shall have opportunity of observing, when
considering the bacteriology of water and sewage, that there
is in these media in nature a keen struggle for the survival
of the fittest bacteria for each special medium. In a carcass
it is the same. If saprophytic bacteria are present with
pathogenic, there is a struggle for the survival of the latter.
Now whilst this is in part due to a competition owing to a
limited food supply and an unlimited population, as occurs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
in other spheres, it is also due in part to the inimical influence
of the chemical products of the one species upon the
life of the bacteria of the other species. Moreover, in one
culture medium, as Cast has pointed out, two species will
often not grow. When Pasteur found that exposure to air
attenuated his cultures, he pointed out that it was not the air
<em>per se</em> that hindered his growth, but it was the introduction
of other species which competed with the original. The
growth of the spirillum of cholera is opposed by <em>Bacillus
pyogenes fœtidus</em>. <em>B. anthracis</em> is, in the body, opposed by
either <em>B. pyocyaneus</em> or <em>Streptococcus erysipelatis</em>, and yet it is
aided in its growth by <em>B. prodigiosus</em>. <em>B. aceti</em> is, under
certain circumstances, antagonistic to <em>B. coli communis</em>.</p>

<p>In several of the most recent of the admirable reports of
Sir Richard Thorne issued from the Medical Department of
the Local Government Board, we have the record of a series
of experiments performed by Dr. Klein into this question of
the antagonism of microbes. From this work it is clearly
demonstrated that whatever opposition one species affords to
another it is able to exercise by means of its poisonous properties.
These are of two kinds. There is, as is now widely
known, the poisonous product named the <em>toxin</em>, into which
we shall have to inquire more in detail at a later stage.
There is also in many species, as Dr. Klein has pointed out,
a poisonous constituent or constituents included in the body
protoplasm of the bacillus, and which he therefore terms the
<em>intracellular poison</em>. Now, whilst the former is different in
every species, the latter may be a property common to
several species. Hence those having a similar intracellular
poison are antagonistic to each other, each member of such
a group being unable to live in an environment of its own
intracellular poison. Further, it has been suggested that
there are organisms possessing only one poisonous property,
namely, their toxin&mdash;for example, the bacilli of tetanus and
diphtheria&mdash;whilst there are other species, as above, possess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>ing
a double poisonous property, an intracellular poison and
a toxin. In this latter class would be included the bacilli of
Anthrax and Tubercle.</p>

<p>Reference has been made to the associated work of higher
vegetable life and bacteria. The converse is also true. Just
as we have bacterial diseases affecting man and animals, so
also plant life has its bacterial diseases. Wakker, Prillieux,
Erwin Smith, and others have investigated the pathogenic
conditions of plants due to bacteria, and though this branch
of the science is in its very early stages, many facts have
been learned. <em>Hyacinth disease</em> is due to a flagellated
bacillus. <em>The wilt of cucumbers and pumpkins</em> is a common
disease in some districts of the world, and may cause widespread
injury. It is caused by a white microbe which fills
the water-ducts. Wilting vines are full of the same sticky
germs. Desiccation and sunlight have a strongly prejudicial
effect upon these organisms. Bacterial <em>brown-rot</em> of potatoes
and tomatoes is another plant disease probably due to a
bacillus. The bacillus passes down the interior of the stem
into the tubers, and brown-rots them from within. There
is another form of brown-rot which affects cabbages. It
blackens the veins of the leaves, and a woody ring which
is formed in the stem causes the leaves to fall off. This
also is due to a micro-organism, which gains entrance through
the water-pores of the leaf, and subsequently passes into the
vessels of the plants. It multiplies by simple fission, and
possesses a flagellum.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that these complex biological properties
of association and antagonism, as well as the parasitic
growth of bacteria upon higher vegetables, are as yet little
understood, and we may be glad that any light is being shed
upon them. In the biological study of soil bacteria in
particular may we expect in the future to find examples of
association, even as already there are signs that this is so
in certain pathogenic conditions. In the alimentary canal, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
the other hand, and in conditions where organic matter is
greatly predominating, we may expect to see further light
on the subject of antagonism.</p>

<p><em>Attenuation of Virulence or Function.</em> It was pointed out
by some of the pioneer bacteriologists that the function of
bacteria suffered under certain circumstances a marked
diminution in power. Later workers found that such a
change might be artificially produced. Pasteur introduced
the first method, which was the simple one of allowing
cultures to grow old before sub-culturing. Obviously a pure
culture cannot last for ever. To maintain the species in
characteristic condition it is necessary frequently to sub-culture
upon fresh media. If this simple operation be
postponed as long as possible consistent with vitality, and
then performed, it will be found that the sub-culture is
<em>attenuated</em>, <em>i. e.</em>, weakened. Another mode is to raise the
pure culture to a temperature approaching its thermal death
point. A third way of securing the same end is to place it
under disadvantageous external circumstances, for example
a too alkaline or too acid medium. A fourth, but rarely
necessary, method is to pass it through the tissues of an
insusceptible animal. Thus we see that, whilst the favourable
conditions which we have considered afford full scope
for the growth and performance of functions of bacteria,
we are able by a partial withdrawal of these, short of that
ending fatally, to modify the character and strength of
bacteria. In future chapters we shall have opportunity of
observing what can be done in this direction.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<h3><small><em>BACTERIA IN WATER</em></small></h3>

<p>In entering upon a consideration of such a common article
of use as water, we shall do well to describe in some
detail the process by which we systematically investigate the
bacteriology of a water, or, indeed, of any similar fluid suspected
of bacterial pollution.</p>

<p>The collection of samples, though it appears simple
enough, is sometimes a difficult and responsible undertaking.
Complicated apparatus is rarely necessary, and
fallacies will generally be avoided by observing two directions.
In the first place, the sample should be chosen as
representative as possible of the real substance or conditions
we wish to examine. Some authorities advise that it is
necessary to allow the tap to run for some minutes previous
to collecting the sample; but if we desire to examine
for lead chemically or for micro-organisms in the pipes
biologically, then such a proceeding would be injudicious.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>
Hence we must use common sense in the selection and
obtaining of a sample, following this one guide, namely,
to collect as nearly as possible a sample of the exact water
the quality of which it is desired to learn. In the second
place, we must observe strict bacteriological cleanliness in
all our manipulations. This means that we must use only
sterilised vessels or flasks for collecting the sample, and in
the manipulation required we must be extremely careful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>to avoid any pollution of air or any addition to the
organisms of the water from unsterilised apparatus. A
flask polluted in only the most infinitesimal degree will
entirely vitiate all results.</p>

<p>Accompanying the sample should be a more or less full
statement of its source. There can be no doubt that, in
addition to a chemical and bacteriological report of a water,
there should also be made a careful examination of its
source. This may appear to take the bacteriologist far
afield, and in point of fact, as regards distance, this may
be so. But until he has seen for himself what "the gathering-ground"
is like, and from what sources come the feeding
streams, he cannot judge the water as fairly as he should be
able to do. The configuration of the gathering-ground, its
subsoil, its geology, its rainfall, its relation to the slopes
which it drains, the nature of its surface, the course of its
feeders, and the absence or presence of cultivated areas, of
roads, of houses, of farms, of human traffic, of cattle and
sheep&mdash;all these points must be noted, and their influence,
direct or indirect, upon the water carefully borne in mind.</p>

<p>When the sample has been duly collected, sealed, and a
label affixed bearing the date, time, and conditions of collection
and full address, it should be transmitted with the
least possible delay to the laboratory. Frequently it is
desirable to pack the bottles in a small ice case for transit.
On receipt of such a sample of water the examination must be
immediately proceeded with, in order to avoid, as far as possible,
the fallacies arising from the rapid multiplication of germs.
Even in almost pure water, at the ordinary temperature of a
room, Frankland found organisms multiplied as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table  style="font-size: .8em;" summary="organisms multiplied" border="0"><tr>

</tr></table>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p>Another series of observations revealed the same sort of
rapid increase of bacteria. On the date of collection the
micro-organisms per cc. in a deep-well water (in April) were
seven. After one day's standing at room temperature the
number had reached twenty-one per cc. After three days
under the same conditions it was 495,000 per cc. At blood-heat
the increase would, of course, be much greater, as a
higher temperature is more favourable to multiplication.
But this would depend upon the degree of impurity in the
water, a pure water <em>decreasing</em> in number on account of the
exhaustion of the pabulum, whereas, for the first few days
at all events, an organically polluted water would show an
enormous increase in bacteria.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is desirable to remember that organisms,
in an ordinary water, do not continue to increase indefinitely.
There is a limit to all things, even to numbers in bacteriology.
Cramer, of Zurich, examined the water of the Lake
after it had been standing for different periods, with the
following results:&mdash;</p>

<table  style="font-size: .8em;" summary="organisms multiplied" border="0"><tr>

</tr></table>

<p>The writer's own experience is entirely in agreement with
this cessation of multiplication at or about the end of a week,
and the later decline.</p>

<p><em>Method of Examination.</em> At the outset of a systematic
study of a water it is well to observe its physical characters.
The colour, if any, should be noted. Suspended matter and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>deposit may indicate organic or inorganic pollution. If
abundant or conspicuous, a microscopic examination of the
sediment may be made. The reaction, whether acid, neutral,
or alkaline, must be tested, and the exact temperature taken.
Any and every fact will help us, perhaps not so much to
determine the contents of the water as to interpret rightly
the facts we deduce from the entire examination.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_b_040.jpg" width="250" height="142" alt="Levelling Apparatus for Koch's Plate" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Levelling Apparatus for Koch's Plate</span></p></div>

<p>At the beginning of the bacteriological work the water
should be examined by means of the gelatine plate method.
This consists in drawing up into a fine sterilised pipette a
small quantity of the water and introducing it thereby into
a test-tube of melted gelatine at a temperature below 40&deg;&nbsp;C.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>
It will depend upon the apparent quality of the water as to
the exact quantity introduced into the gelatine; about .5 or
.1 of a cubic centimetre is a common figure. The stopper is
then quickly replaced in the test-tube, and the contents gently
mixed more or less equally to distribute the one-tenth cubic
centimetre throughout the melted gelatine. A sterilised sheet
of glass (4 inches by 3) designated a <em>Koch's plate</em> is now
taken and placed upon the stage of a levelling apparatus,
which holds iced water in a glass jar under the stage.
The gelatine is now poured out over the glass plate, and by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>means of a sterilised rod stroked into a thin, even film all
over the glass. It is then covered with a bell-jar and left
at rest to set. The level stage prevents the gelatine running
over the edge of the plate; the iced water under the stage
expedites the setting of the gelatine into a fixed film. When
it is thus set the plate is placed upon a small stand in a
moist chamber, and the whole apparatus removed to the
room temperature incubator. A <em>moist chamber</em> is a glass
dish, in which some filter paper, soaked with corrosive sublimate,
is inserted, and the dish covered with a bell-jar. By
this means the risks of pollution are minimized, and moisture
maintained. In all cases at least two plates must be prepared
of the same sample of water, and it is often advisable
to make several. They may be made with different media
for different purposes, and with different quantities of water,
though the same method of procedure is adopted. In a
highly polluted water extremely small quantities would be
taken, and, <em>vice versâ</em>, in pure water a large quantity.</p>

<p>When we come to discuss the relation of disease organisms
to water, particularly those causing typhoid fever, we
shall learn that they are both scarce and intermittent. This
point has been dwelt upon frequently by Dr. Klein, and it
is clear that such a state of things greatly enhances the difficulties
in detecting such bacteria, and he has proposed a
simple procedure by which the difficulty of finding the
<em>Bacillus typhosus</em> in a large body of water may be met.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Hot Air Steriliser</span><br />
<small>For the Sterilization of Glass Apparatus, etc.</small></p></div>

<p>One or two thousand cubic centimetres of the water under
examination are passed through a sterilised Berkefeld filter
by means of siphon action or an air-pump. The candle of
the filter retains on its outer surface all, or nearly all, the
particulate matter contained in the water. The matter thus
retained on this outer surface is brushed by means of a
sterile brush into 10 or 20 cc. of sterilised water. Thus we
have all the organisms contained in two litres of the water
reduced into 10 cc. of water. From this, so to speak, con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>centrated
emulsion of the bacteria of the original water,
phenol-gelatine plates or Eisner plates (both acid media)
may be readily made. In this way we not only catch many
bacteria which would evade us if we were content with the
examination merely of a few drops of the water, but we
eliminate by means of the acid those common water bacteria,
like <em>Bacillus fluorescens liquefaciens</em>, which so greatly confuse
the issue.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_b_043.jpg" width="400" height="332" alt="Bacteria" /></div>

<p>In the course of two or three days the film of gelatine
on the plate becomes covered with <em>colonies</em> of germs, and the
next step is to examine these quantitatively and qualitatively.
We may here insert a simple scheme by which this
may be most fully and easily accomplished:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <em>Naked-Eye Observation of the Colonies.</em> By this means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
at the very outset certain facts may be obtained, viz., the size,
elevation, configuration, margin, colour, grouping, number,
and kinds of colonies, all of which facts are of importance,
and assist in final diagnosis. Moreover, in the case of gelatine
plates (it is otherwise in agar) one is able to observe
whether or not there is present what is termed <em>liquefaction
of the gelatine</em>. Some organisms produce in their development
a peptonizing ferment which breaks down gelatine into
a fluid condition. Many have not this power, and hence
the characteristic is used as a diagnostic feature.</p>

<p>2. <em>Microscopic Examination of Colonies</em>, which confirms or
corrects that which has been observed by the naked eye.
Fortunately some micro-organisms when growing in colonies
produce cultivation features which are peculiar to themselves
(especially is this so when growing in test-tube
cultures), and in the early stages of such growths a low
power of the microscope or magnifying glass facilitates
observation.</p>

<p>3. <em>Make cover-glass preparations</em>: (<em>a</em>) unstained&mdash;"the
hanging drop"; (<em>b</em>) stained&mdash;single stains, like gentian-violet,
methyl blue, fuchsin, carbol fuchsin, etc.; double stains&mdash;Gram's
method, Ziehl-Neelsen's method, etc.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_b_044.jpg" width="200" height="78" alt="The Hanging Drop" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Hanging Drop</span></p>
</div>

<p>This third part of the investigation is obviously to prepare
specimens for the microscope. "The hanging drop" is a
simple plan for securing the organisms for microscopic
examination in a more or less natural condition. A hollow
ground slide, which is a slide with a shallow depression in it,
is taken, and a small ring of vaseline placed round the edge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
of the depression. Upon the under side of a clean cover-glass
is placed a drop of pure water, and this is inoculated
with the smallest possible particle taken from one of the
colonies of the gelatine plate on the end of a sterilised
platinum wire. The cover-glass is then placed upon the
ring of vaseline, and the drop hangs into the space of the
depression. Thus is obtained a view of the organisms in a
freely moving condition, if they happen to be motile bacteria.
As a matter of practice the hollow slide may be
dispensed with, and an ordinary slide used.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_b_045.jpg" width="250" height="123" alt="Drying Stage for Fixing Films" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Drying Stage for Fixing Films</span></p></div>

<p>With regard to staining, it will be undesirable here to
dwell at length upon the large number of methods which
have been adopted. The "single stain" may be shortly mentioned.
It is as follows: A clean cover-glass is taken (cleaned
with nitric acid and alcohol, or bichromate of potash and
alcohol), and a drop of pure sterilised water placed upon it.
This is inoculated with the particle of a colony on the end
of a platinum needle, and a scum is produced. The film is
now "fixed" by slowly drying it over a flame. When the
scum is thus dried, a drop of the selected stain (say gentian-violet)
is placed over the scum and allowed to remain for
varying periods: <em>sarcin&aelig;</em> about thirty seconds; for many of
the bacilli three or four minutes. It is then washed off with
clean water, dried, and mounted in Canada balsam. The
organisms will now appear under the microscope as violet
in colour, and will thus be clearly seen.</p>

<p>The "double staining" is adopted when we desire to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
stain the organisms one colour and the tissue in which they
are situated a contrast colour. Some of the details of these
methods are mentioned in the Appendix.</p>

<p>4. <em>Sub-culture.</em> The plate method was really introduced
by Koch in order to facilitate isolation of species. In a
flask it is impossible to isolate individual species, but when
the growth is spread over a comparatively large area, like
a plate, it is possible to separate the colonies, and this being
done by means of a platinum wire, the colonies may be
replanted in fresh media; that is to say, a <em>sub-culture</em> may
be made, each organism cultivated on its favourite soil, and
its manner of life closely watched. We have already mentioned
the chief media which are used in the laboratory, and
in an investigation many of these would be used, and thus
<em>pure cultures</em> would be obtained. Let us suppose that a
water contains six kinds of bacteria. On the plate these
six kinds would show themselves by their own peculiar
growth. Each would then be isolated and placed in a separate
tube, on a favourite medium, and at a suitable temperature.
Thus each would be a <em>pure culture</em>; <em>i. e.</em>, one
and only one, species would be present in each of the six tubes.
By this simple means an organism can be, we say, <em>cultivated</em>,
in the same sort of way as in floriculture. From day to
day we can observe the habits of each of our six species,
and probably at an early stage of their separated existences
we should be able to diagnose what species of bacteria we
had found in the water. If not, further microscopic examination
could be made, and, if necessary, secondary or tertiary
sub-cultures.</p>

<p>5. <em>Inoculation of Animals.</em> It may be necessary to
observe the action of supposed pathogenic organisms upon
animals. This is obviously a last resource, and any abuse
of such a process is strictly limited by law. As a matter of
fact, an immense amount of bacteriological investigation can
be carried on without inoculating animals; but, strictly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
speaking, as regards many of the pathogenic bacteria, this
test is the most reliable of all. Nor would any responsible
bacteriologist be justified in certifying a water as healthy for
consumption by a large community if he was in doubt as to
the disease-producing action of certain contained organisms.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_b_047.jpg" width="300" height="297" alt="Types of Liquefaction of Gelatine" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Types of Liquefaction of Gelatine</span></p></div>

<p>By working through some such scheme as the above we
are able to detect what quantity and species of organisms,
saprophytic or parasitic, a water or similar fluid contains.
For, observe what information we have gained. We have
learned the form (whether bacillus, micrococcus, or spirillum),
size, consistence, motility, method of grouping, and staining
reactions of each micro-organism; the characters of its culture,
colour, composition, presence or absence of liquefication or
gas formation, its rate of growth, smell, or reaction; and
lastly, when necessary, the effect that it has upon living
tissues. Here, then, are ample data for arriving at a satisfactory
conclusion respecting the qualitative estimation of
the suspected water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span></p>

<p>As to to the quantitative examination, that is fulfilled by
counting the number of colonies which appear, say by the
third and fourth day, upon the gelatine plates. Each colony
has arisen, it is assumed, from one individual, so that if we
count the colonies, though we do not thereby know how
many organisms we have upon our plate, we do know
approximately how many organisms there were when the
plate was first poured out, which are the figures we require,
and which can at once be multiplied and returned as so
many organisms per cubic centimetre. There is, unfortunately,
at present no exact standard to which all bacteriologists
may refer.</p>

<p>Miquel and Crookshank have suggested standards which
allow "very pure water" to contain up to 100 micro-organisms
per cc. Pure water must not contain more than 1000,
and water containing up to 100,000 bacteria per cc. is contaminated
with surface water or sewage. Macé gives the
following table:</p>

<p>Koch first laid emphasis on the quantity of bacteria present
as an index of pollution, and whilst different authorities
have all agreed that there is a necessary quantitative limit,
it has been so far impossible to arrive at one settled standard
of permissible impurity.</p>

<p>Besson adopts the standard suggested by Miquel, and, on
the whole, French bacteriologists follow suit. They also
agree with him, generally speaking, in not placing much
emphasis upon the numerical estimation of bacteria in water.
In Germany and England it is the custom to adopt a stricter
limit. Koch in 1893 fixed 100 bacteria per cc. as the maximum
number of bacteria which should be present in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
properly filtered water. Hence the following has been
recognised more or less as the standard:</p>

<p>The personal view of the writer after some experience of
water examination would favour a standard of "under 500"
being a potable water, if the 500 were of a nature indicating
neither sewage pollution nor disease. Miquel holds that not
more than ten different species of bacteria should be present
in a drinking water, and such is a useful standard. The
presence of rapidly liquefying bacteria <em>associated with sewage
or surface pollution</em> would, even though present in fewer
numbers than a standard, condemn a water. Thus it will
be seen that it is impossible to judge alone by the numbers
unless they are obviously enormously high.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Wolfhügel's Counter</span></p>

<p>When we are counting colonies upon a Koch's plate,
<em>Wolfhügel's counter</em> may be used. This is a thin plate of
glass a size larger than Koch's plates, and upon it are
scratched squares, each square being divided into nine
smaller squares. The Wolfhügel plate is superimposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
upon the Koch's plate, and the colonies counted in one little
square or set of squares and multiplied.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Petri's Dish</span></p>
</div>

<p>By using flat, shallow, circular glass dishes, generally known
as <em>Petri's dishes</em>, instead of Koch's plates, much manipulation
and time is saved, and, on the whole, less risk of pollution
occurs. Moreover, these are easily carried about and transferred
from place to place. When counting colonies in a
Petri's dish it is sufficient to divide the circle into eight equal
divisions, and counting the colonies in the average divisions,
multiply and reduce to the common denominator of one
cc. For example, if the colonies of the plate appear to be
distributed fairly uniformly we count those in one of the
divisions. They reach, we will suppose, the figure of 60;
60 × 8=480 micro-organisms in the amount taken from the
suspected water and added to the melted gelatine from
which the plate was made. This amount was .25 cc. Therefore
we estimate the number of micro-organisms in the suspected
water as 60 × 8=480 × 4= 1920 m.-o. per cc., which
is over standard by about 1500. A water might then be
condemned upon its quantitative examination alone or qualitative
alone, or both. If the quantity were even that of an
artesian well, say 4&ndash;10 m.-o. per cc., but those four or ten
were all <em>Bacillus typhosus</em>, it would clearly be condemned on
its quality, though quantitatively it was an almost pure
water. If, on the contrary, the water contained 10,000 m.-o.
per cc., and none of them disease-producing, it would still be
condemned on the ground that so large a number of organisms
indicated some kind of organic pollution to supply
pabulum for so many organisms to live in one cc. of the water.
It is not the number <em>per se</em> which condemns. The large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
number condemns because it indicates probable pollution
with surface water or sewage in order to supply pabulum
for so many bacteria per cc.</p>

<p>It should always be remembered that a chemical report
and a bacteriological report should assist each other. The
former is able to tell us the quantity of salts and condition
of the organic matter present; the latter the number and
quality of micro-organisms. Neither can take the place of
the other and, generally speaking, both are more or less useless
until we can learn, by inspection and investigation of the
source of the water, the origin of the organic matter or contamination.
Hence a water report should contain not only
a record of physical characters, of chemical constituents, and
of the presence or absence of micro-organisms, injurious and
otherwise, but it should also contain information obtained by
personal investigation of the source. Only thus can a reasonable
opinion be expected. Moreover, it is generally only
possible to form an accurate judgment of a water from
watching its history, that is, not from one examination only,
but from a series of observations. A water yielding a steady
standard of bacterial contents is a much more satisfactory
water, from every point of view, than one which is unstable,
one month possessing 500 bacteria per cc. and another
month 5000. It is obvious that rainfall and drought, soil
and trade effluents, will have their influence in materially
affecting the bacterial condition of a water.</p>

<p>It is perhaps scarcely necessary to add that we have not
in the above account of the examination of water included
all, or nearly all, the various methods adopted for acquiring
a knowledge of the bacterial contents of the water. Many of
these are of too detailed and technical a nature to enter into
here. Three points, however, we may touch upon. In the
first place, as we have said, the particulate matter out of a
large body of water should be concentrated in a small
quantity. Accordingly it has become the custom to pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
2000 or 3000 cc. of the suspected water through a Berkefeld
filter. When this has been accomplished, by means of a
<span class="figleft125">
<img src="images/i_b_052.jpg" width="125" height="320" alt="Berkefeld Filter" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Berkefeld&nbsp;Filter</span><br />
<small>In Position for Filtration
of Water to
be Examined.</small></span></span>
sterile brush the particulate matter on the
candle of the filter is brushed off into 10 or
15 cc. of sterilised water. This simple arrangement
is analogous to the use of gravity
or centrifugal methods of securing the solid
matter in milk. The smaller quantity of
water is then readily examined, and scanty
germs more readily detected. A second
point elaborating the scheme of water examination
is the choice of media for sub-culturing.
Mere examination on gelatine is not
sufficient. Even in making the primary
plate cultivations it is well to vary the media&mdash;agar,
carbol-gelatine, Elsner, etc. But
when colonies have appeared upon these
plates it is important to sub-culture with
accuracy and good judgment upon all or any
media&mdash;gelatine, agar, broth, potato, milk,
blood serum, glucose agar, glycerine agar,
etc.&mdash;that will reveal the real characters of
the bacteria present. A method proposed
by Professor Sheridan Delépine is to place
some of the suspected water in sterilised
test-tubes without further treatment, and incubate at 37&deg;
C. for twelve or eighteen hours, and then plate out and
estimate the number of bacteria as in the ordinary course.
"In polluted water, containing an excess of organic matter,"
he says, "an extremely rapid multiplication of bacteria is
observed. In unpolluted water, containing only water bacteria
and a very small amount of organic matter, very little or no
multiplication takes place, and the growth of the water bacteria
liquefying gelatine is checked to a remarkable extent."
Thirdly, by none of these methods should we be able to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>isolate anaërobic bacteria, and to furnish a complete report
these also must receive careful attention.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

Examination" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Apparatus for Filtering Water to Facilitate its Bacteriological
Examination</span></p></div>

<p><em>The Bacteriology of Water.</em> In many natural waters there
will be found varied contents even in regard to flora alone:
<em>alg&aelig;</em>, <em>diatoms</em>, <em>spirogyr&aelig;</em>, <em>desmids</em>, and all sorts of vegetable
detritus. Many of these organisms are held responsible for
divers disagreeable tastes and odours. The colour of a water
may also be due to similar causes. Dr. Garrett, of Cheltenham,
has recorded the occurrence of redness of water owing
to a growth of <em>Crenothrix polyspora</em>, and many other similar
cases make it evident that not unfrequently great changes may
be produced in water by contained microscopic vegetation.</p>

<p>With the exception of water from springs and deep wells,
all unfiltered natural waters contain numbers of bacteria.
The actual number roughly depends upon the amount of organic
pabulum present, and upon certain physical conditions
of the water. As we have already seen, bacteria multiply with
enormous rapidity. In some species multiplication does not
appear to depend on the presence of much organic matter,
and, indeed, some can live and multiply in sterilised water:
<em>Micrococcus aquatilis</em> and <em>Bacillus erythrosporus</em>. Again,
others depend not upon the quantity of organic matter, but
upon its quality. And frequently in a water of a high degree
of organic pollution it will be found that bacteria have
been restrained in their development by the competition of
other species monopolising the pabulum. Probably at least
one hundred different species of non-pathogenic organisms
have been isolated from water. Some species are constantly
occurring, and are present in almost all natural waters.
Amongst such are <em>B. liquefaciens</em>, <em>B. fluorescens liq.</em>, <em>B. fluorescens
non-liquefaciens</em>, <em>B. termo</em>, <em>B. aquatilis</em>, <em>B. ubiquitus</em>,
and not a few <em>micrococci</em>, etc. Percy Frankland<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> collected

<p>Professor Percy Frankland also points out how the river
Dee affords another example, even more perfect, of pollution
and restoration repeated several times until the river becomes
almost bacterially pure.</p>

<p>We cannot here enter more fully into the many conditions
of a water which affect its bacterial content than to say that
it varies considerably with its source, at different seasons,
and under different climatic conditions. An enormous increase
will occur if the sediment is disturbed, and conversely
sedimentation and subsidence during storage will greatly
diminish the numbers of bacteria. Sand filtration, plus a
"nitrifying layer," will remove more than 90 per cent. of the
bacteria. Sea-water contains comparatively few bacteria,
and the deeper the water and the farther it is from shore so
much less will be the bacterial pollution.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap lowercase">THE CHIEF DISEASE ORGANISMS FOUND IN WATER</span></h3>

<p>We will now consider several of the more important disease-producing
bacteria found in water.</p>

<p><b>Bacillus Typhosus</b> (Eberth-Gaffky). In 1880&ndash;81 Eberth
announced the discovery of this bacillus in cases of clinical
enteric fever. In 1884 it was first cultivated outside the
body by Gaffky. Since then other organisms have been held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
responsible for the causation of enteric (or typhoid) fever.
In 1885 the <em>B. coli communis</em> was recognised, and it has been
a matter of great debate amongst bacteriologists as to how
far these two organisms are the same species, and the
typhoid germ merely a higher evolution of the <em>B. coli</em>. The
differentiating signs between them will be referred to shortly.
Bacteriologists generally regard the Eberth-Gaffky bacillus
as the specific cause of the disease, though complete proof
is still wanting.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_b_056.jpg" width="200" height="155" alt="Bacteria of Typhoid Fever" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Bacteria of Typhoid Fever</span></p>
</div>

<p><em>Microscopic Characters</em> (in pure culture). Rods, 2&ndash;4 µ long,
.5 µ broad, having round ends. Sometimes threads are observable,
being 10 µ in length. In the field of the microscope
the bacilli differ in length from each other, but are all the
same thickness approximately. Round and oval cells constantly
occur even in pure culture, and many of these shorter
forms of typhoid are identical in morphology with some of
the many forms of <em>Bacillus coli</em>. There are no spores.
Motility is marked; indeed, in young culture it is the most
active pathogenic germ we know. The small forms dart
about with extreme rapidity; the longer forms move in a
vermicular manner. Its powers of movement are due to
some five to twenty flagella of varying length, some of them
being much longer than the bacillus itself, though, owing to
the swelling of the bacillus under flagellum-staining methods,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
it is difficult to gauge this exactly. The flagella are terminal
and lateral, and are elastic and wavy. Their active contraction
produces an evident current in the field of the
microscope.</p>

<p><em>Cultures.</em> This organism may be isolated from ulcerated
Peyer's patches in the intestine, from the liver, the spleen,
and the mesenteric glands. Owing to the mixture of bacteria
found elsewhere, it is generally best to isolate it from the
spleen. The whole spleen is removed, and a portion of its
capsule seared with a hot iron to destroy superficial organisms.
With a sterilised knife a small cut is made into the
substance of the organ, and by means of a sterilised platinum
wire a little of the pulp is removed and traced over the surface
of agar. <em>Agar</em> reveals a growth in about twenty-four
hours at 37&deg;&nbsp;C., which is the favourite temperature. A greyish,
moist, irregular growth appears, but it is invariably attached
to the track of the inoculating needle. On <em>gelatine</em>
the growth is much the same, but its irregular edge is, if anything,
more apparent. There is no liquefaction and no gas
formation. On plates of gelatine the colonies appear large
and spreading, with jagged edges. The whole colony appears
raised and almost limpet-shaped, with delicate lines
passing over its surface. There is an appearance under a low
power of transparent iridescence. The growth on <em>potato</em> is
termed "invisible," and is of the nature of a potato-coloured
pellicle, which looks moist, and may at a late stage become
a light brown in colour, particularly if the potato is alkaline.
<em>Milk</em> is a favourable medium, and is rendered slightly acid.
No coagulation takes place. <em>Broth</em> is rendered turbid.</p>

<p><em>Micro-pathology.</em> Typhoid fever is an infiltration and coagulation,
necrosis, and ulceration of the Peyer's patches in
the small intestine of man. The mesenteric glands show the
same features, except that there is no ulceration. The spleen
is enlarged, and contains the germs of the disease in almost
a pure culture. The bacillus is present in the intestinal con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>tents
and excreta, particularly so when the Peyer's glands
have commenced ulceration. In the blood of the general
circulation the bacillus is not demonstrable, except in very
rare instances. Typhoid fever is not, like anthrax, a blood
disease.</p>

<p>The two species, <em>Bacillus typhosus</em> and <em>B. coli</em>, agree in
possessing the following characters: no spores, no liquefaction
of gelatine; both grow well on phenolated gelatine, and
in Parietti's broth; both act similarly upon animals, though
typhoid fever is not a specific disease of animals.</p>

<p>The <em>Bacillus typhosus</em>, though a somewhat susceptible
bacillus, can when dried retain its vitality for weeks. In
sewage it is very difficult indeed to detect, and is soon
crowded out. Dr. Andrews and Mr. Parry Laws, in their
bacterial researches into sewage for the London County
Council,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> found that when they examined specially infected
typhoid sewage it was only with extreme difficulty they
isolated Eberth's bacillus. In ordinary sewage it is clear
such difficulty would be greatly enhanced.</p>

</div>

<p>We have pointed out elsewhere the relation between soil
and typhoid. In water, even though we know it is a vehicle
of the disease, the <em>Bacillus typhosus</em> has been only very rarely
detected. The difficulties in separating the bacillus from
waters (like that at Maidstone, for example), which appear
definitely to have been the vehicle of the disease, are manifold.
To begin with, the enormous dilution must be borne
in mind, a comparatively small amount of contamination
being introduced into large quantities of water. Secondly,
the huge group of the <em>B. coli</em> species considerably complicates
the issues, for it copiously accompanies the typhoid,
and is always able to outgrow it. Further, we must bear in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>mind a point that is systematically neglected, namely, that
the bacteriological examination of a water which is suspected
of having conveyed the disease is from a variety of circumstances
conducted too late to detect the causal bacteria. The
incubation period of typhoid we may take at fourteen days.
Let us suppose a town water supply is polluted with some
typhoid excreta on the 1st of January. Until the 14th of
January there may be no knowledge whatever of the state
of affairs. Two or three days are required for notification of
cases. Several more days elapse generally before bacteriological
evidence is demanded. Hence arises the anomalous
position of the bacteriologist who sets to work to examine a
water suspected of typhoid pollution three weeks previously.
There can be no doubt that these difficulties are very real
ones. The solution to the problem will be found in Dr.
Klein's dictum that "a water in which sewage organisms
have been detected in large numbers should be regarded
with suspicion"<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> as the vehicle of typhoid, even though no
typhoid bacilli were discoverable. The chief of these sewage
bacteria are believed to be <em>Proteus vulgaris</em>, <em>B. coli</em>, <em>P. zenkeri</em>,
and <em>B. enteritidis</em>, and they are all nearly related to <em>B. typhosus</em>.
The presence of the <em>B. coli</em> in limited numbers is not suffi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>cient
to indicate sewage pollution, seeing that it is so widely
distributed. But in large numbers, and in company with the
other named species, it is almost certain evidence of sewage-polluted
water.</p>

<p>It may occur to the general reader that, as the typhoid
bacillus is not extremely rare, drinking water may frequently
act as a vehicle to carry the disease to man. But, to
appreciate the position, it is desirable to bear in mind the
following facts: the typhoid bacillus is only found in the
human excrement of patients suffering from the disease;
it is short-lived; in ordinary waters there exist organisms
which can exert an influence in diminishing its vitality;
exposure to direct sunlight destroys it; and it has a tendency
to be carried down-stream, or in still waters settle
at the bottom by subsidence. Even when all the conditions
are fulfilled, it must not be forgotten that a certain definite
dose of the bacillus is required to be taken, and that by
a susceptible person. Into these latter questions of how
bacteria produce disease we shall have an opportunity of
inquiring at a later stage.</p>

<p>We must now mention several of the special media and
tests used in the separation of <em>Bacillus typhosus</em> and <em>B. coli</em>.</p>

<p>1. <em>The Indol Reaction.</em> Indol and skatol are amongst the
final products of digestion in the lower intestine. They are
formed by the growth, or fermentation set up by the growth,
of certain organisms. Indol may be recognised on account
of the fact that with nitrous acid it produces a dull red
colour. The method of testing is as follows. The suspected
organism is grown in pure culture in broth, and incubated for
forty-eight hours at 37&deg;&nbsp;C. Two cc. of a 4 per cent. solution
of potassium nitrite are added to 100 cc. of distilled water,
and about 1 cc. of this is added to the test-tube of broth
culture. Now a few drops of concentrated sulphuric acid
(unless quite pure, hydrochloric should be used) are run
down the side of the tube. A pale pink to dull red colour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
appears almost at once, and may be accentuated by placing
the culture in the blood-heat incubator for half an hour.
Much dextrose (derived from the meat of the broth) inhibits
the reaction. <em>Bacillus typhosus</em> does not produce indol, and
therefore does not react to the test; <em>B. coli</em> and the bacillus
of Asiatic cholera do produce indol, and react accordingly.
It should be pointed out, however, that the bacillus of cholera
also produces nitrites. Hence the addition of acid only to a
peptone culture of cholera yields the "red reaction" of indol.</p>

<p>2. <em>Carbolised Gelatine.</em> To ordinary gelatine .05 per cent.
of phenol is added. This inhibits many common water
bacteria.</p>

<p>3. "_Shake Cultures._" To 10 cc. of melted gelatine a small
quantity of the suspected organism is added. The test-tube
is then shaken and incubated at 22&deg;&nbsp;C. If the organism is
<em>Bacillus coli</em>, the next day reveals a large number of gas-bubbles.</p>

<p>4. <em>Elsner's Medium.</em> This special potassium-iodide-potato-gelatine
medium is used for the examination of typhoid
excreta. It is made as follows: 500 grams of potato
gratings are added to 1000 cc. of water; stand in cool place
for twelve hours, and filter through muslin; add 150 grams
of gelatine; sterilise and add enough deci-normal caustic
soda until only faintly acid; add white of egg; sterilise and
filter. Before use add half a gram of potassium iodide to
every 50 cc. Upon this acid medium common water bacteria
will not grow, but <em>Bacillus typhosus</em> and <em>B. coli</em> flourish.</p>

<p>5. <em>Parietti's Formula</em> consists of&mdash;phenol, five grams;
hydrochloric acid, four grams; distilled water, 100 cc. To
10 cc. of broth 0.1&ndash;0.3 cc. of this solution is added. The
tube is then incubated in order to see if it is sterile. If
that is so, a few drops of the suspected water are added,
and the tube reincubated at 37&deg;&nbsp;C. for twenty-four hours.
If the water contains the <em>B. typhosus</em> or <em>B. coli</em>, the tube will
show a turbid growth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span></p>

<p>6. <em>Widal's Reaction.</em> Mix a loopful of blood from a patient
suspected of typhoid fever with a loopful of young typhoid
broth culture in a hanging drop on a hollow ground slide.
Cover with a cover glass and examine under 1/6-inch objective.
If the patient is really suffering from typhoid, there will appear
in the hanging drop two marked characteristics, viz.,
agglutination and immotility. This aggregation, together
with loss of motility, is believed to be due to the inhibitory
action of certain bacillary products in the blood of patients
suffering from the disease. The test may be applied in various
ways, and its successful issue depends upon one or two small
points in technique into which we cannot enter here, but
which the reader will find dealt with in the appendix.</p>

<p>7. <em>Flagella-staining.</em> Special methods must be adopted
for staining the flagella of <em>Bacillus typhosus</em> and <em>B. coli</em>. The
cover glasses should be absolutely clean, the cultures young
(say eighteen hours old), and a diluted emulsion with distilled
water must be made in a watch-glass in order to get
bacilli discrete and isolated enough. <em>Van Ermengem's
Method</em> is as follows:&mdash;Place a loopful of the emulsion
on a clean cover glass and dry it in the air, fixing it lastly
by passing it once or twice through the flame of a Bunsen
burner. Place films for thirty minutes in a solution of one
part boric acid (2 per cent.) and two parts of tannin (15.25
per cent.), which also contains four or five drops of glacial
acetic acid to every 100 cc. of the mixture. Wash in
distilled water and alcohol. Then place for five to ten seconds
in a 25.5 per cent. solution of silver nitrate. Immediately
thereafter, and without washing, treat the cover glass to the
following solution for two or three seconds: gallic acid, five
grams; tannin, three grams; fused potassium acetate, ten
grams; distilled water, 350 cc. After this place in a fresh
capsule of silver nitrate until the film begins to turn black.
Wash in distilled water, dry, and mount. The process contracts
the bacilli somewhat, but the flagella stain well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span></p>

<p>The Bacillus coli communis occupies such an important
place in all bacteriological investigation that a few words
descriptive of it are necessary in this place. The "colon
bacillus," as it is termed, appears to be almost ubiquitous in
distribution. The idea once held that it belonged exclusively
to the alimentary canal or sewage is now discarded. It is
one of the most widely distributed organisms in nature,
though, as its name implies, its habitat is in the intestinal
tract of man and animals. It is an aërobic, non-sporulating,
non-liquefying bacillus, about .4 µ in thickness, and twice
that measurement in length; hence it often appears oval or
egg-shaped. Its motility is in varying degree, occasionally
being as active as <em>B. typhosus</em>, but generally much less so.
It possesses lateral flagella. On gelatine plates at 20&deg;&nbsp;C.
<em>B. coli</em> produces non-liquefying, greyish-white, round colonies;
in a stroke culture on the same medium, a luxuriant greyish
band, much broader and less restricted to the track of the
needle than <em>B. typhosus</em>. In depth of medium or "shake"
cultures there is an abundant formation of bubbles of gas
(methane or carbon dioxide) in the medium. On potato it
produces a light yellow, greasy growth, which must be distinguished
from the growth of <em>B. fluorescens liquefaciens</em>,
<em>B. pyocyaneus</em>, and several other species on the same medium.
If the potato is old or alkaline, the yellow colour may not
appear. Milk is curdled solid in from twenty-four to forty-eight
hours, and a large amount of lactic acid produced.
In broth it produces a uniform turbidity, with later on
some sediment and a slight pellicle. It gives the reaction
to indol.</p>

<p>It is now the practice to speak of the family of <em>Bacillus coli</em>
rather than the individual. The family is a very large one,
and shows throughout but few common characters. The
morphology readily changes in response to medium, temperature,
age, etc. Fermentation of sugar, coagulation of
milk, or indeed the indol reaction cannot always be used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
as final tests as to whether or not the organism is <em>B. coli</em>, for
unfortunately some members of the family do not show each
of these three features. Most varieties, however, appear
to show some motility, a small number of flagella, a typical
growth on potato, and develop more rapidly on all media
than <em>B. typhosus</em>. These characters, plus one or more of
the three features above named, are diagnostic data upon
which reliance may be placed.</p>

<p><b>Cholera.</b> This word is used to cover more a group of diseases
rather than one specific well-restricted disease. In recent
years it has become customary to speak of Asiatic cholera
and British cholera, as if indeed they were two quite different
diseases. But, as a matter of fact, we know too little as yet
concerning either form to dogmatise on the matter. Until
1884 practically nothing was known about the etiology of
cholera. In that year, however, Koch greatly added to our
knowledge by isolating a spirillum from the intestine and in
the dejecta of persons suffering from the disease.</p>

<p>Cholera has its home in the delta of the Ganges. From
this endemic area it spreads in epidemics to various parts of
the world, often following lines of communication. It is a
disease which is characterised by acute intestinal irritation,
manifesting itself by profuse diarrhœa and general systemic
collapse, with cramps, cardiac depression, and subnormal
temperature. The incubation period varies from only a few
hours to several days. In the intestine, and setting up its
pathological condition, are the specific bacteria; in the
general circulation their toxic products, bringing about the
systemic changes. Cholera is generally conveyed by means
of water.</p>

<p>The spirillum of Asiatic cholera (Koch, 1884) generally
appears, in the body and in artificial culture, broken into
elements known as "commas." These are curved rods with
round ends, showing an almost equal diameter throughout,
and sometimes united in pairs or even a chain (spirillum).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
The latter rarely occur in the intestine, but may be seen in
fluid cultures. The common site for Koch's comma is in the
intestinal wall, crowding the lumina of the intestinal glands,
situated between the epithelium and the basement membrane,
abundant in the detached flakes of mucous membrane, and
free in the contents of the intestine. They do not occur in
the blood, nor are they distributed in the organs of the
body.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_b_066.jpg" width="200" height="210" alt="The Comma-Shaped Bacilli of Cholera" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Comma-Shaped Bacilli of Cholera</span></p>
</div>

<p>The bacilli are actively motile, and possess at least one
terminal flagellum. The organism is aërobic, and liquefies
gelatine. It stains readily with the ordinary aniline dyes.
It does not produce spores, though certain refractile bodies
inside the protoplasm of the bacillus in old cultures have
been regarded as such. The virulence of the bacillus is
readily attenuated, and both the virulence and morphology
appear to show in different localities and under different
conditions of artificial cultivation a large variety of what
are termed <em>involution forms</em>. Unless the organism is constantly
being sub-cultured, it will die. Acid, even the .2 per
cent. present in the gastric juice, readily kills it. Desiccation,
55&deg;&nbsp;C. for ten minutes, and weak chemicals have the same
effect. The bacilli, however, have comparatively high powers
of resistance to cold. Unless examined by the microscope
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>in a fresh and young stage, it is difficult to differentiate
Koch's comma from many other curved bacilli.</p>

<p>Its cultivation characters are not always distinctive.
Microscopically the young colonies in gelatine appear as
cream-coloured, irregularly round, and granular. Liquefaction
sets in on the second day, producing a somewhat
marked "pitting" of the medium, which soon becomes
reduced to fluid. In the depth of gelatine the growth is
very characteristic. An abundant, white, thick growth
exactly follows the track of the needle, here and there often
showing a break in continuity. Liquefaction sets in on the
second day, and produces a distinctive "bubble" at the
surface. The liquefied gelatine does not fall from the sides
of the tube, as in the Finkler-Prior comma of <em>cholera nostras</em>,
but occurs inside the border where the gelatine joins the
glass. In the course of a week or two all the gelatine may
be reduced to fluid. On agar Koch's comma produces with
rapidity a thick, greyish, irregular growth. On potato,
especially if slightly alkaline, an abundant brownish layer is
formed. Broth and peptone water are excellent media.
In milk it rapidly multiplies, curdling the medium, with
production of acid. Unlike <em>Bacillus coli</em>, it does not form
gas, but, like <em>B. coli</em>, it produces large quantities of indol
and a reduction of nitrates to nitrites. Hence the indol test
may be applied by simply adding to the peptone culture
several drops of strong sulphuric acid, when in the course
of several hours, if not at once, there will be produced a
pink colour, the "cholera red reaction." Although it
readily loses virulence, and its resistance is little, the comma
bacillus retains its vitality for considerable periods in moist
cultures, upon moist linen, or in moist soil. In cholera
stools kept at ordinary room temperature the cholera bacillus
will soon be outgrown by the putrefactive bacteria. The
same is true of sewage water.</p>

<p>The lower animals do not suffer from any disease at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
similar to Asiatic cholera, and hence it is impossible to fulfil
the postulate of Koch dealing with animal inoculation. In
this respect it is like typhoid. It is, however, provisionally
accepted that Koch's bacillus is the cause of the disease.
The four or five other bacteria which have from time to time
been put forward as the cause of cholera have comparatively
little evidence in their support. It is less from these, and
more from several spirilla occurring in natural waters, that
difficulties of diagnosis arise.</p>

<p>Some hold that, however many comma bacilli be introduced
into the alimentary canal, they will not produce the
disease unless there is some injury or disease of the wall of
the intestine. It need hardly be added that cholera acts,
like other pathogenic bacteria, by the production of toxins.
Brieger separated cadaverin and putrescin and other bodies
from cholera cultures, and other workers have separated a
tox-albumen.</p>

<p><em>Methods of Diagnosis of Cholera</em>:</p>

<p>1. The nature of the evacuations and the appearance of
the mucous membrane of the intestine afford striking evidence
in favour of a positive diagnosis. Nevertheless it is
upon a minute examination of the flakes and pieces of detached
epithelium that reliance must be placed. In these
flakes will be found in cholera abundance of bacilli having
the size, shape, and distribution of the specific comma of
cholera. The size and shape have been already touched
upon. The distribution is frequently in parallel lines,
giving an appearance which Koch described as the "fish-in-stream
arrangement." This distribution of comma bacilli
in the flakes of watery stools is, when present, so characteristic
of Asiatic cholera that it alone is sufficient for a definite
diagnosis. But unfortunately it is not always present, and
then search for other characters must be made.</p>

<p>2. The appearance of cultivation on gelatine, to which
reference has been made, is of diagnostic value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span></p>

<p>3. The "cholera red reaction." It is necessary that the
culture be pure for successful reaction.</p>

<p>4. Isolation from water is, according to Dr. Klein, best
accomplished as follows: A large volume of water (100&ndash;500
cc.) is placed in a sterile flask, and to it is added so much
of a sterile stock fluid containing 10 per cent. peptone, 5 per
cent. sodium chloride, as will make the total water in the
flask contain 1 per cent. peptone and .5 per cent. salt. Then
the flask is incubated at 37&deg;&nbsp;C. If there have been cholera
vibrios in the water, however few, it will be found after
twenty-four hours' incubation that the top layer contains
actively motile vibrios, which can now be isolated readily
by gelatine-plate culture.</p>

<p>5. To demonstrate in a rapid manner the presence of
cholera bacilli in evacuations, even when present in small
numbers, a small quantity must be taken up by means of a
platinum wire and placed in a solution containing 1 per cent.
of pure peptone and .5 per cent. sodium chloride (Dunham).
This is incubated as in the case of the water, and in twelve
hours is filled with a turbid growth, which when examined
by means of the hanging drop shows characteristic bacilli.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap lowercase">NATURAL PURIFICATION OF WATER</span></h3>

<p>We have already noticed that rivers purify themselves as
they proceed. There are many excellent examples of this
self-purification. The Seine as it runs through Paris becomes
highly polluted with every sort of filthy contamination.
But twenty or thirty miles below the city it is found
to be even purer than above the city before it received the
city sewage. In small rivers it is the same, provided the
pollution is less in amount. Whilst authorities differ with
regard to the mode of self-purification, all agree that in
some way rivers receiving crude sewage are able in a marvellous
degree to become pure again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span></p>

<p>The conditions influencing this phenomenon are as follows:</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) <em>The Movement of the Water.</em> It is probable, however,
that any beneficial result accruing from this cause is due, not
to any mechanical factor in the movement, but to the extra
surface of water available for oxidation processes.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) <em>The Pressure of the Water.</em> It is believed that the
volume of water pressing down upon any given area beneath
it weakens the vitality of certain microbes. In support
of this theory, it is urged that the number of bacteria
capable of developing is less the greater the depth from the
surface. Yet it must be remembered that mud at the bottom
of a river, or at the bottom of the sea, is teeming with
living organisms.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) <em>Light.</em> We have seen how prejudicial is light to the
growth of organisms in culture media. This is so, though
to a less extent, in water. Arloing held that sunlight could
not pierce a layer of water an inch in thickness and still act
inimically on micro-organisms. But Buchner found that the
sun's rays could pass through fifteen or twenty inches and
yet be bactericidal. This evidence appears contradictory.
On the whole, however, authorities agree that the influence
of the sun's rays upon water is distinctly bactericidal and
causes a marked diminution in the quantity of organisms
after acting for some hours. Especially will this be so when
the water is spread over a wide area and is therefore shallow
and stationary, or moving but slowly.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) <em>Vegetation in Water.</em> Pettenkofer, in his observations
upon the Iser below Munich, has shown how alg&aelig; bring
about a marked reduction in the organic matters present in
water.</p>

<p>(<em>e</em>) <em>Dilution.</em> There can be no doubt in anyone's mind
that the pollutions passing into a flowing river are very soon
diluted with the large quantities of comparatively pure
water always forthcoming. But this, whilst it would lower
the percentage of impurity, cannot remove impurities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<p>(<em>f</em>) <em>Sedimentation.</em> Whilst Pettenkofer attributes self-purification
to oxygenation and vegetation, most authorities
are now agreed that it is largely brought about by the subsidence
of impure matters, and by their subsequent disintegration
at the bottom of the river. Sedimentation
obviously is greatest in still waters. Hence lake water
contains as a rule very few bacteria. "The improvement
in water during subsidence is the more rapid and pronounced
the greater the amount of suspended matter initially present"
(Frankland). Tils has pointed out that the number
of micro-organisms was invariably smaller in the water collected
from the reservoir than in that taken from the source
supplying the latter. Percy Frankland has demonstrated
the same effect of sedimentation by storage as follows:</p>

<table style="font-size: .8em;" summary="sedimentation by storage" border="0"><tr>

<p>The large reservoir would of course necessitate a prolonged
subsidence, and hence a greater diminution than in the small
reservoirs. Many like examples might be cited, but a typical
one such as the above will suffice.</p>

<p>(<em>g</em>) <em>Oxidation.</em> Many experiments and observations have
been made to prove that large quantities of oxygen are used
up daily in oxygenising the Thames water. Oxygenated
water will come up with the tide and down with the fresh
water from above London. There will also be oxygen absorption
going on upon the surface of the water, and from
these three sources enough oxygen is obtained to oxidise
impurities and produce what is really an effluent. In many
smaller streams the opportunity for oxidation is afforded by
weirs and falls.</p>

<p>Probably all these factors play a part in the self-purifica<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>tion
of rivers, but we may take it that oxidation, dilution,
and sedimentation are three of the principal agencies.</p>

<p>We may here digress to refer in passing to the facts obtainable
from Sir Edward Frankland's report on Metropolitan
water supply in 1894, as they will afford a connecting link
between self purification and artificial purification. Judged
by the relatively low proportion of carbon to nitrogen, the
organic matter present in the water was, as usual, found to
be chiefly, if not entirely, of vegetable origin. An immense
destruction of bacteria was found to be effected by storage
in subsidence reservoirs. The bacterial quality of the water
might differ widely from its chemical qualities. These
three facts are of primary importance in the interpretation
of water reports, and it will be well to bear them in mind.
Sir E. Frankland also refers to the physical conditions
affecting microbial life in river waters. The importance of
changes of temperature, the effect of sunlight, and rate of
flow had been referred to in previous reports. Respecting
the relative proportion of these factors, he adds:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The number of microbes in Thames water is determined
mainly by the flow of the river, or, in other words, by the rainfall,
and but slightly, if at all, by either the presence or absence of
sunshine, or a high or low temperature. With regard to the
effect of sunshine, the interesting researches of Dr. Marshall
Ward leave no doubt that this agent is a powerful germicide, but
it is probable that the germicidal effect is greatly diminished, if
not entirely prevented, when the solar rays have to pass through
a comparatively thin stratum of water before they reach the living
organisms."</p></div>

<p>From which it is clear that evidence favours the effect of
sedimentation and dilution. These two factors in conjunction
with filtration are, practically speaking, the methods of
artificial water purification, with which we are now in a
position to deal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap lowercase">ARTIFICIAL PURIFICATION OF WATER</span></h3>

<p><em>Sedimentation and Precipitation.</em> Naturally, we see this
factor in action in lakes or reservoirs. For example, the
water supply of Glasgow is the untreated overflow from
Loch Katrine. Purification has been brought about by
means of subsidence of impurities. Nothing further is
needed. Artificially, we find it is this factor which is
the mechancial purifier of biological impurity in such
methods as <em>Clark's process</em>. By this mode "temporary
hardness," or that due to soluble bicarbonate of lime, is
converted into insoluble normal carbonate of lime by the
addition of a suitable quantity of lime-water. Carbonates
of lime and magnesia are soluble in water containing free
carbonic acid, but when fresh lime is added to such water
it combines with the free CO<sub>2</sub> to form the insoluble carbonate,
which falls as a sediment:</p>

<p class="center">
CaCO<sub>3</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> + CaH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (lime-water) = 2 CaCO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O.<br />
</p>

<p>As the carbonate falls to the bottom of the tank it carries
down with it the organic particles. Hence sedimentation
is brought about by means of chemical precipitation. It is
obviously a mechanical process as regards its action upon
bacteria. Nevertheless its action is well-nigh perfect, and
300 or 400 m.-o. per cc. are reduced to 4 or 5 per cc. We
shall refer to this same action when we come to speak of
bacterial purification of sewage. <em>Alum</em> has been frequently
used to purify waters which contain much suspended matter.
Five or six grains of alum are added to each gallon of
water, with some calcium carbonate by preference. Precipitation
occurs, and with it sedimentation of the bacteria, as
before. But, as Babes has pointed out, alum itself acts
inimically on germs; in such treatment, therefore, we get
sedimentation and germicidal action combined.</p>

<p>As a matter of actual practice, however, sedimentation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
alone is rarely sufficient to purify water. It is true that the
collection of water in large reservoirs permits subsidence of
suspended matters, and affords time for the action of light
and the competitive suicidal behaviour of the common water
bacteria. Yet, after all, filtration is the most important
and most reliable method.</p>

<p><em>Sand Filtration</em>, as a means of purifying water, has been
practised since the early part of the present century. But
it was not till 1885 that Percy Frankland first demonstrated
the great difference in bacterial content between a water unfiltered
and a water which had passed through a sand filter.
Previous to this time the criterion of efficiency in water purification
had been a chemical one only, and the presence or
absence of bacteria in any appreciable quantity was described,
not in mathematical terms, but in indefinite descriptive
words, like "turbid," "cloudy," etc. It is needless to say
that this difference in estimation was due to the introduction
by Koch of the gelatine-plate method of examination. As
a result of Percy Frankland's work, he formulated the following
conclusions as regards the chief factors influencing
the number of microbes passing through the filter.</p>

<p>It depends upon:</p>

<p>(1) <em>The Storage Capacity for Unfiltered Water.</em> This, of
course, has reference to the advantages, which we have
noticed above, of securing a large collection of water previous
to filtration for subsidence, etc.</p>

<p>(2) <em>The Thickness of Fine Sand through which Filtration is
Carried on.</em> An argument needing no further support, for
it is clear, other things being equal, the more sand water
passes through the greater the opportunity of leaving its
impurities behind.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Rate of Filtration.</em> The slower filtration will be generally
the more complete in its results.</p>

<p>(4) <em>Renewal of Filter-Beds.</em> After a certain time the filter-bed
becomes worn out and inefficient; at such times renewal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
is necessary. Not only may the age of the filter act prejudicially,
but the extra pressure required will tend to force
through it bacteria which ought to have remained in the filter.</p>

<p>In 1893, Koch brought out his monograph upon <em>Water
Filtration and Cholera</em>, and his work had a deservedly great
influence upon the whole question. He shows how the
careful filtration of water supplied to Altona from the Elbe
saved the town from the epidemic of cholera which came
upon Hamburg as a result of drinking unfiltered water, although
Altona is situated several miles below Hamburg, and
its drinking water is taken from the river after it has received
the sewage of Hamburg. Now, from his experience of
water filtration, Koch arrived at several important conclusions.
In the first place, he maintained that the <em>portion of
the filter-bed which really removed micro-organisms effectively
was the slimy organic layer upon the surface</em>. This layer is
produced by a deposit from the still unpurified water lying
immediately above it. The most vital part of the filter-bed
is this organic layer, which, after formation, should not be
disturbed until it requires removal owing to its impermeability.
A filter-bed, as is well known, consists of say three
feet of sand and one foot of coarse gravel. The water to
be filtered is collected into large reservoirs, where subsidence
by gravitation occurs. Thence it is led by suitable
channels to the surface of the filter-bed. Having passed
through the three or four feet of the bed, it is collected in a
storage reservoir and awaits distribution. The action of the
whole process is both mechanical and chemical. Mechanically
by subsidence, much suspended matter is left behind in
the reservoir. Again, mechanically, much of that which
remained suspended in the water when it reached the filter-bed
is waylaid in the substance of the sand and gravel of the
filter-bed. Chemically also the action is twofold. Oxidation
of the organic matter occurs to some extent as the water
passes through the sand. Until recently this chemical action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
and the double mechanical action were believed to be the complete
process, and its efficiency was tested by chemical oxidation
and alteration, and absence of the suspended matter.</p>

<p>Now, however, it is recognised that the second portion
of the chemical action is vastly the more important, indeed,
the only vital, part of the process. This is the chemical
effect of the layer of scum and mud on the surface of the
sand at the top of the filter-bed. The mechanical part of
this layer is, of course, the holding back of the particulate
matter which has not subsided in the reservoir; the vital
action consists in what is termed <em>nitrification</em> of unoxidised
substance, which is accomplished in this layer of organic
matter. We shall deal at some length with the principles
of nitrification when we come to speak of soil. But we may
say here that by nitrification is understood a process of
oxidation of elementary compounds of nitrogen, by which
these latter are built up into stable bodies which can do
little harm in drinking water. From what has been said it
will be seen that the action of a filter-bed is of a complicated
nature. There is (1) subsidence of the grosser particles of
impurity in the water; (2) mechanical obstruction to impurities
in the interstices of the scum, sand, and gravel in the
filter; (3) oxidation of organic matter by the oxygen held in
the pores of the sand and gravel; (4) nitrification in the
vital scum layer, which is accomplished by micro-organisms
themselves. This latter is now considered to be incomparably
the most important part of the filter. That being so,
its removal, except when absolutely necessary, is to be
avoided as detrimental to the efficiency of the filter. New
filters have obviously but little of this action. Hence it is
wise to allow a new filter-bed to act for a short period (say
twenty-four to forty-eight hours) before the filtered water is
used for domestic purposes, in order to allow the organic
layer to be formed. This must also be borne in mind after
a filter-bed has been cleaned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span></p>

<p>To maintain this nitrifying action of a filter in efficiency,
Koch suggested, in the second place, <em>that the rate of filtration
must not exceed four inches per hour</em>. At the Altona
water-works this rate of filtration was maintained, and the
number of organisms always remained below 100 per cc.,
which, as we have seen, is the standard. Thirdly, it is important
that <em>periodic bacteriological examinations should be
made</em>. Koch's emphasis upon this point is well known, and
the cumulative experience of bacteriologists only further
supports such a course being taken. If it be true that
efficient sand filtration is a safeguard against pathogenic
germs like typhoid and cholera, then there can be but one
criterion of efficiency, viz., their absence in the filtered
water, which can only be ascertained by regular examination.
But it is not alone for pathogenic germs that filtration
is proposed. Filtered water containing more than 100
micro-organisms of any kind per cc. is below the standard
in purity, and should on no account be distributed for drinking
purposes. In this country chemical analysis, with a
more or less cursory microscopic examination, has been
almost invariably accepted as reliable indication of the condition
of the water. But such an examination is not really
any more a fair test of the working of the filter than it is of
the actual condition of the water. It is true, the quantity
of organic matter can be estimated and the condition in
which it exists in combination obtained; but it cannot tell
us what a bacteriological examination can tell us, viz., the
quantity and quality of living micro-organisms present in
the water. Upon this fact, after all, an accurate conclusion
depends. There is abundant evidence to show that no
valuable opinion can be passed upon a water except by both
a chemical and a bacteriological examination, and further
by a personal investigation, outside the laboratory, of the
origin of the water and its liabilities to pollution.</p>

<p>So convinced was Koch of the efficiency of sand filtration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
as protection against disease-producing germs that he advocated
an adaptation of this plan in places where it was found
that a well yielded infected water. Such pollution in a well
may be due to various causes; surface-polluted water oozing
into the well is probably the commonest, but decaying
animal or vegetable matter might also raise the number of
micro-organisms present almost indefinitely. Koch's proposal
for such a polluted well was to fill it up with gravel to
its highest water level, and above that, up to the surface of
the ground, with fine sand. Before the well is filled up in
this manner it must, of course, be fitted with a pipe passing
to the bottom and connected with a pump. This simple
procedure of filling up a well with gravel and sand interposes
an effectual filter-bed between the subsoil water and any
foul surface water percolating downwards. Such an arrangement
yields as good, if not better, results than an ordinary
filter-bed, on account of there being practically no disturbance
of the bed nor injury done to it by frost.</p>

<p>The effect of the remedies we have been discussing upon
the number of bacteria is demonstrated in the results which
Sir Edward Frankland arrived at in his investigation of
London waters.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>The teaching of these figures could, with great ease, be
reproduced again and again if such was necessary; but these
will suffice to show that sand filtration, when carefully
carried out, offers a more or less absolute barrier to the
passage of bacteria, whether non-pathogenic or pathogenic.</p>

<p><em>Domestic Purification of Water.</em> Something may here be
said, from a bacteriological point of view, relative to what
is called <em>domestic purification</em>. There is but one perfectly
reliable method of sterilising water for household use, viz.,
<em>boiling</em>. As we have seen, moist heat at the boiling point
maintained for five minutes will kill all bacteria and their
spores. The only disadvantages to this process are the
labour entailed and the "flat" taste of the water. Nevertheless
in epidemics due to bad water it is desirable to revert
to this simple and effectual purification.</p>

<p>There are a large number of filters on the market with, in
many cases, but little modification from each other. The
materials out of which they are made are chiefly the following:
carbon and charcoal, iron (spongy iron or magnetic
oxide), asbestos, porcelain and other clays, natural porous
stone, and compressed siliceous and diatomaceous earths.
From an extended research in 1894 by Dr. Sims Woodhead
and Dr. Cartwright Wood our knowledge of the quality of
these substances as protectives against bacteria has been
largely increased. They concluded that a filter failed to act
in one of two ways. It was either pervious to micro-organisms,
or its power of filtering became modified owing to (<em>a</em>)
structural alteration of its composition, or to (<em>b</em>) the growing
through of the micro-organisms. The conditions which
chiefly influence the growth of bacteria through a filter appear
to be the temperature, the intermittent use of the filter,
and the species of bacteria. The higher the temperature
and the longer the organisms are retained in the filter
the more likely is it that they will grow through, and in
the next usage of the filter appear in the filtrate. As to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
species, those multiplying rapidly and possessing the power
of free motility will naturally appear earlier in a filtrate
than others. Woodhead and Wood, from their searching
and most able investigation, concluded that the Pasteur-Chamberland
<span class="figleft100">
<img src="images/i_b_080.jpg" width="100" height="302" alt="Pasteur-Chamberland
Filter" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Pasteur-Chamberland
Filter</span><br /><small>Attached to Water Supply</small></span></span>
candle filters (composed of porcelain
formed by a mixture of kaolin and other
clays) were the only filters out of the substances
named above which were reliable and protective
against bacteria. They tested over three dozen
of the Pasteur filters, and "in every case these
gave a sterile filtrate." Pure cholera bacillus
in suspension (5000 bacilli to every cc.) and
typhoid bacillus in suspension (8000 per cc.)
were passed through these filters, and not a
single bacillus was detectable in the filtrate.
The Berkefeld filter (siliceous earth) came
second on the list as an effective filter, and had
but the fault of not being a "continuous"
steriliser. A certain Parisian filter ("Porcelaine
d'Amiante"), made of unglazed porcelain,
rendered water absolutely free from
bacteria. Its action was, however, very slow.
Setting aside these three efficient filters, we
are face to face with the fact that most filters
do not produce germ-free filtrates, even though
they are nominally guaranteed to do so. It is professed
for <em>animal charcoal</em>, which is widely used, that it absorbs
oxygen, and so fully oxidises whatever passes through it.
This may be so at first, but after a little use it probably
does more harm than good. It appears to add nitrogen
and phosphates to water, which are both nutritive substances
on which bacteria grow. Moreover it readily absorbs
impurities from the air. As a matter of experiment
and practice, it has been found by Frankland, Woodhead,
and others, that charcoal actually adds to the number of
germs after it has been in use for some days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>

<p><em>Diseases Conveyed by Water.</em> There are a few preliminary
features to be noticed before we enter in detail upon the
characteristics of several of the chief pathogenic bacteria in
water.</p>

<p>In sterilised water, and in very highly polluted water or
sewage, pathogenic bacteria do not flourish. In the former
case they die of starvation, although there are some experiments
on record which appear not to support this view; in
the latter case they are killed by the enormous competition
of common bacteria. Even in ordinary water there is a
wide divergence of behaviour. Some bacteria are destroyed
in a few hours; others appear to flourish for weeks. In all
cases the spores are able to resist whatever injurious properties
the water may have much more persistently than the
bacilli themselves. These changes in the vitality of bacteria
in water, partly due to the water and partly to the other
micro-organisms, bring about two characteristics which it is
important to remember, viz., that pathogenic germs in water
are, as a rule, <em>scanty</em> and <em>intermittent</em>. It is these features
in conjunction with the enormous quantities of common
water bacteria which make the search for the bacillus of
typhoid what Klein has called "searching for a needle in a
rick of hay." Not that it cannot be detected, but its detection
is one of the most difficult of investigations. We
shall refer to this matter again when <em>Bacillus typhosus</em> is
under consideration.</p>

<p>In artificial cultivation water bacteria respond very readily
to external conditions. Increase of alkalinity (.01 grams of
sodium carbonate added to 10 cc. of ordinary gelatine)
causes the number of colonies to be five or six times greater
than that revealed by using ordinary gelatine; on the other
hand, very slightly increasing the acidity of a medium as
markedly diminishes the number of bacteria. Advantage is
taken of this in culturing the bacillus of typhoid, which does
not object to an acid medium.</p>

<p>Water may become polluted in a variety of ways, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
is helpful to classify these as pollutions at the <em>source</em>, in the
<em>course</em>, and at the <em>periphery</em>. Gathering-grounds are frequently
the locality of the pollution. The recent Maidstone
epidemic is an example. Here some of the springs supplying
the town with water were contaminated by several
typhoid patients. Frequently on the gathering-ground one
may find a number of houses the waste and refuse of which
will furnish ample surface pollution, which in its turn may
readily pass into a collecting reservoir or a well. Only recently
the writer investigated the cause of typhoid in a large
country house, and traced it to pollution of the private well
by surface washings from the stable quarters. Leakage of
house-drains into wells is not an infrequent source of contamination.
The same cause is generally operative in cases
of pollution of a water supply in its <em>course</em> from the source
to the cisterns or taps at the periphery, viz., a sewer or drain
leaking into the water supply.</p>

<p>Water companies and those responsible for water supply
appear to hold the opinion that so long as there is sand
filtration or subsidence reservoirs it is unnecessary to consider
the gathering-ground or transit. But, as we have
seen, a frost may completely dislocate the efficient action
of a filter, and times of flood may prevent proper sedimentation;
then our dependence for pure water is wholly upon
the gathering-ground and source. Hence we find water contaminated
at its source by polluted wells, by sewage-infected
rivers and streams, by drainage of manured fields, by innumerable
excremental pollutions over the areas of the
gathering-grounds, and in transit by careless laying, poor
construction, bad jointing, and close proximity of water-and
drain-pipes. In the third place, we may get a water infected
at the <em>periphery</em>, in the house itself. Such cases are generally
due to one of two causes: filthy cisterns or suction. Cisterns
<em>per se</em> are more or less indispensable where a constant service
does not exist, but they should be inspected from time to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
time and maintained in a cleanly condition. Suction into
the tap has been recently emphasised by Dr. Vivian Poore
as a cause of pollution. It is liable to occur whenever a tap
is left turned on, and a vacuum is produced in the supply-pipe
by intermission of the water supply, so that foul gas or
liquid is sucked back into the house-pipe.</p>

<p>One more point requires our attention. It has relation
to bacterially polluted water when it has gained entrance to
the body. It has been known for some time past that not
all waters polluted with disease germs produce disease. As
we have before said, this may depend upon the infective
agent, its quantity and quality; the body being able in
many cases to resist a small dose of poison. It is, however,
necessary to infection, especially in water-borne disease, that
the tissues shall be in some degree disordered. The perverted
action of the stomach influences the acid secretion
of the gastric juice, through which bacilli might then pass
uninjured. Particularly must this be so in the bacillus of
cholera, which is readily killed by the normal acid reaction
of the stomach. Hence, in this disease at least, it is the
opinion of bacteriologists that the condition of the mucous
membrane of the stomach is of primary importance. Metschnikoff
has indeed demonstrated the presence of the bacillus
of cholera in the intestinal excretion of apparently
healthy persons, which shows that they were protected by
the resistance of their tissues to the bacilli. Further light
has been thrown on this question by the researches of MacFadyen,
who has pointed out that suspensions of cholera
bacilli in water passed through the stomach untouched, and
were thus able to exert their evil influence in other parts of
the alimentary canal. When, however, cholera bacilli were
suspended in milk, none appeared to escape the germicidal
action of the gastric juice. The explanation of this is probably
the simple one that the stomach reacted with its secretion
of gastric juice only to food (milk), but simply passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
the water on into the lower and more absorptive parts of the
alimentary canal. Such a condition of affairs clearly increases
the danger of water-borne germs.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap lowercase">THE BACTERIOLOGY OF SEWAGE AND SEWAGE-POLLUTED
WATERS</span></h3>

<p>It will not be needful to insist upon the obvious fact that
bacteria abound in sewage. Such a large quantity of organic
matter, in which decomposition is constantly taking place,
will afford an almost ideal nidus for micro-organic life.
There is indeed but one reason why such a medium is not
absolutely ideal from the microbe's point of view, and that
reason is, that in sewage the vast number of bacteria present
make the struggle for existence exceptionally keen. Not
only are the numbers incredibly large, but we also find a
very extensive representation of species, including both
saprophytes and parasites, non-pathogenic and pathogenic.
Not infrequently it is from pollution by sewage that drinking
water is contaminated with disease. A patient, we will
say, suffers from typhoid fever. The specific organism has
its habitat largely, though not exclusively, in the alimentary
canal. It passes out in the excreta, and though sometimes
partially disinfected, may escape without hindrance into the
drains, and thus to the sewer or cesspool. How often, by
means of direct connection or by percolation, sewage, from
sewers or cesspools, gains access to drinking water, the
history of typhoid outbreaks in this country only too fully
records.</p>

<p>It is impossible to lay down any exact standard of the
chemical and bacteriological quality of sewage. The quality
will differ according to the size of the community, the
inclusion or otherwise of trade-waste effluents, the addition
of rain-water, and other like physical conditions. Moreover,
sewage itself when, so to speak, fully formed is liable to
undergo rapid changes owing to fermentation and the com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>petition
of micro-organisms. It is clear that these latter are
the chief agents in bringing about the change, because, if
sewage be placed in hermetically sealed flasks and sterilised
by heat, it is found that no change occurs. From facts such
as the above it will be apparent that no exact standard of
chemical or bacterial contents is possible. Respecting the
chemical condition we may shortly say that the chief characteristic
of sewage is its enormous amount of contained
organic matter in suspension or solution; respecting the
bacterial content we may say that the chief species of the
very numerous organisms are those commonly concerned in
fermentative putrefaction. London crude sewage contains
on an average about four millions of micro-organisms per
cc. Many of these are "liquefying" bacteria; that is to
say, they have the power of liquefying gelatine, which is
generally one of the features of putrefactive species. In
considering the quality of the bacteria present in sewage, a
still wider field of research opens before us. For though we
can say that, roughly, all sewage will contain probably between
four and eight millions of bacteria, we cannot even
lay down a rough standard respecting the kinds of bacteria
present more than we have done already in stating that a
very large number indeed out of the total will belong to
putrefactive species.</p>

<p>We may, however, make a provisional list of normal
sewage bacteria<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> as follows:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span></p>
<p>1. <em>Bacillus coli communis</em> and all its varieties and allies.</p>

<p>2. <em>Proteus vulgaris</em> and the various protean species.</p>

<p>3. <em>B. enteritidis sporogenes</em> (Klein).</p>

<p>4. Liquefying bacteria, <em>e. g.</em>, <em>Bacillus fluorescens liquefaciens</em>,
<em>B. subtilis</em>, <em>B. mesentericus</em>.</p>

<p>5. Non-liquefying bacteria.</p>

<p>6. Sarcin&aelig;, yeasts, and moulds.</p>

<p>We have not included in the above inventory any pathogenic
bacteria. Doubtless such species (<em>e. g.</em>, typhoid<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>) not
infrequently find their way into sewage. But they are not
normal habitants, and though they struggle for survival, the
keenness of competition among the dense crowds of saprophytes
makes existence almost impossible for them. Nor
can they expect much sympathy from us in the difficulties
of life which fortunately confront them in sewage.</p>

<p>Of those we have named as normally present it is unnecessary
to speak in detail, with the exception of the newly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>discovered anaërobe, <em>Bacillus enteritidis sporogenes</em> of Klein.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>
This bacillus is credited to be a causal agent in diarrhœa, and
has been isolated by Dr. Klein from the intestinal contents
of children suffering from severe diarrhœa, and from adults
having cholera nostras. It has been readily detected in
sewage from various localities, and also in sewage effluents,
after sedimentation, precipitation, and filtration. Its biological
characters are shortly as follows: It is in thickness
somewhat like the bacillus of symptomatic anthrax, thicker
and shorter than the bacillus of malignant œdema, and
standing therefore between the latter and anthrax itself. It
is motile and possesses flagella, but has no threads. It
readily forms spores, which develop as a rule near the ends
of the rods and are thicker than the bacilli. It is stained by
Gram's method. In various media (particularly milk) it
produces gas rapidly. It is an anaërobe, and is cultivated
in Buchner's tubes. A recent epidemic of diarrhœa affecting
144 patients in St. Bartholomew's Hospital was traced
to milk in which <em>B. enteritidis</em> was present.</p>

<p><em>Sewer Air.</em> Though not of material importance as regards
bacterial treatment of sewage, this subject calls for
some remark. For long it has been known that air polluted
by sewage emanations is capable of giving rise to various
degrees of ill-health. These chiefly affect two parts of the
body; one is the throat, and the other is the alimentary
canal. Irritation and inflammation may be set up in both
by sewer air. Such conditions are in all probability produced
by a lowering of the resistance and vitality of the
tissues, and not by either a conveyance of bacteria in sewer
air or any stimulating effect upon bacteria exercised by
sewer air. What evidence we have is against such factors.
(See p. 105.)</p>

<p>Several series of investigations have been made into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>bacteriology of sewer air, amongst others by Uffelmann,
Haldane, Laws, and Andrewes. From their labours we
may formulate four simple conclusions:</p>

<p>1. The air of sewers contains very few micro-organisms
indeed, sometimes not more than two organisms per litre
(Haldane), and generally fewer than the outside air (Laws
and Andrewes).</p>

<p>2. There is no relationship between the microbes contained
in sewer air and those contained in sewage. Indeed,
there is a marked difference which forms a contrast as striking
as it is at first sight unexpected. The organisms isolated
from sewer air are those commonly present in the open
air. Micrococci and moulds predominate, whereas in sewage
bacilli are most numerous. Liquefying bacteria, too,
which are common in sewage, are extremely rare in sewer
air. <em>Bacillus coli communis</em>, which occurs in sewage from
20,000 to 200,000 per cc., is altogether absent from sewer air.</p>

<p>3. Pathogenic organisms and those nearly allied to them
are found in sewage, but absent in sewer air. Uffelmann
isolated the <em>Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus</em> (one of the
organisms of suppuration), but such a species is exceptional
in sewer air. Hence, though sewer air is popularly held
responsible for conveying diphtheria and all sorts of other
virulent bacteria, there is up to the present no evidence of a
substantial nature in support of such views. Sewer air
neither conducts pathogenic organisms nor stimulates the
virulence of such.</p>

<p>4. Lastly, only when there is splashing in the sewage, or
when bubbles are bursting (Frankland), is it possible for
sewage to part with its contained bacteria to the air of the
sewer.</p>

<p>Whilst we cannot here enter more fully into an account of
the bacteria found in sewage or of their functions, it is necessary
to remark upon one distinguishing feature. A very
large number of sewage bacteria are <em>decomposing</em> and <i>denitri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>fying</i>,
that is to say, breakers down, by means of putrefaction,
of organic compounds. The knowledge of this fact
has recently been applied, in conjunction with oxidation, to
the biological treatment of sewage. As this illustrates in a
marked degree some of the facts we have dwelt upon in considering
the bacteriology of soil, and as it is likely that the
future will witness a still wider application of these same
facts, it will be necessary to refer in some detail to the
matter.</p>

<p>Hitherto there has been adopted one of four methods of
treatment of sewage. In the first place, in towns situated
on the coast the sewage has, by means of a conduit, been
<em>carried out to sea</em>. It is clear that such a course, which is in
itself open to criticism, is applicable to but few towns. In
the second place, methods of <em>chemical treatment</em> have been
practised. This has generally been of the nature of a
"precipitation" process. Six to twelve grains of quicklime
have been added to each gallon of sewage. The process is
simple and cheap, but it does not remove the organic matter
in solution. On the one hand, it does not produce a valuable
manure; on the other, it fails to purify the effluent. A
dozen other methods have been tried, but all based on the
addition of chemical substances to precipitate or change the
organic matter of the sewage. Electrolysis, too, has been
proposed. The third mode adopted in the past has been
that known as <em>intermittent downward filtration</em>. This may
be defined as "the concentration of sewage at short intervals
on an area of specially chosen porous ground, as small
as will absorb and cleanse it, not excluding vegetation, but
making the product of secondary importance" (Metropolitan
Sewage Commission). The action is mechanical and biological,
that is to say, due in part to nitrification by bacteria
in the upper layers of soil. The fourth plan is that of <em>irrigation</em>,
or "the distribution of sewage over a large surface
of ordinary agricultural ground, having in view a maximum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
growth of vegetation (consistently with due purification) for
the amount of sewage supplied." Like the former, there is
biological influence at work here, though in a less degree.
About one acre is required for every hundred persons in the
population. These two latter modes are much to be preferred
to chemical treatment, yet on account of space and
management, as well as on account of the non-removal of
the "sludge," their success has not been all that could
be desired. Until comparatively recent times the above
methods of treating sewage were the only ones available.</p>

<p>In 1881 it appears that M. Louis Mouras, of Vesoul (Haute
Saône), published an account of a hermetically sealed,
inodorous, and automatically discharging cesspool, in which
sewage was anaërobically broken down by "the mysterious
agents of fermentation." This is the first record we have
of the newly applied treatment of sewage by simply allowing
Nature to fulfil her function by means of bacteria. We
shall most easily arrive at an appreciation of the recent developments
of the process in England by describing the
so called septic tank and cultivation beds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/i_b_091.jpg" width="500" height="290" alt="A Plan of Septic Tank and Filter-Beds" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Plan of Septic Tank and Filter-Beds</span><br />
<small>As Used at Exeter</small></p>
</div>

<p>The <em>septic tank</em> is a large underground vault of cemented
brick, having a capacity of thousands of gallons, according
to the population. That at Exeter has a capacity of 53,800
gallons, and takes the average sewage of 1500 inhabitants in
twenty-four hours. Near the entrance is a submerged wall,
seven feet from the entrance and twelve inches below the
surface of the liquid in the full tank. Within this are caught,
by gravity, gravel and such-like deposits. The remaining
solid matter of the sewage becomes deposited in the tank itself.
Both in the sediment at the bottom of the tank and in
the thick scum on the surface the organic compounds are
broken down and made soluble. In the former position this is
accomplished by anaërobic bacteria, in the latter on the surface
by aërobic bacteria. It need hardly be added that these
are denitrifying and putrefactive bacteria, and that those at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a><br /><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>the bottom of the tank perform greater service than those
at the top. When the liquid sewage passes out of the tank
it differs from the crude sewage which enters the tank in the
following particulars: (<em>a</em>) The gravel and particulate débris
have been removed; (<em>b</em>) the organic solids in suspension are
so greatly diminished that they are almost absent; (<em>c</em>) there
is an increase of organic matter in solution; (<em>d</em>) the sewage
is darker in colour and more opalescent; (<em>e</em>) compounds like
albuminoid ammonia, urea, etc., have been more or less
completely broken down, and reappear in elementary conditions,
like ammonia, methane, carbon dioxide, and sulphuretted
hydrogen. These latter bodies may be in solution
or may have escaped as gas.</p>

<p>The <em>cultivation beds</em> are four or five filters, to which the
sewage from the tank flows in such a manner as to produce
a weir. By an automatic arrangement the fluid is distributed
to each filter in turn. When the second filter is full the
first is discharged, and remains empty during the time that
the third and fourth are being filled. Each filter is thus
full, say, about six hours, and has from ten to twelve hours'
rest. These filter-beds (at Exeter) have an area of eighty
square yards and a depth of five feet; collecting drains are
laid on the bottom of the filters, joining main collectors,
the latter terminating in discharging wells. The filtrant is
broken furnace clinker or broken coke.</p>

<p>The changes occurring in these filters are of the nature of
oxidation, with the result that the proportion of the oxidised
nitrogen increases (as nitrites and nitrates), the ammonia
becomes less, and the total solids and organic nitrogen
almost disappear. It will thus be seen that the work of
these filters is not merely a straining action. It is true that
particulate matter in the effluent from the tank is caught on
the surface by the film (resulting from previous effluents),
but the real work of the bed is <em>nitrification</em>, an oxidation of
ammonia into nitrites and nitrates. This change obviously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
begins when the tank effluent flows over the "weir" on to
the filter-beds, and the oxygen thus obtained by the effluent
is carried down in solution into the coke-breeze. Upon the
surface of the filtrant are oxidising bacteria. When the
effluent is on the bed they oxidise its contained products;
when the bed is empty and "resting" they oxidise carbon.
An advantage arising from the periodical emptying and
filling of the filter is that the products of decomposition
which would eventually inhibit the action of the aërobic
bacteria are washed away, and pass into the nearest stream,
where they become absolutely innocuous.</p>

<p>The "filter" is more correctly termed a <em>cultivation bed</em>,
for its purpose is to furnish a very large surface upon which
the nitrifying organisms present, as we have seen, in all soils,
may flourish, and thus feeding upon the organic matter of
the sewage, may perform their function of oxidation.</p>

<p>It is not possible to lay down exact limits as to where
denitrification ends and oxidation begins. To a certain
extent, and in varying degree, they overlap each other.
But roughly we may say that in the tank there is a breaking
down (denitrification and decomposition) and in the filter-beds
a building up (nitrification). The case is precisely
parallel to similar changes occurring in soil, and which we
have dealt with elsewhere. The advantage indeed of this
biological treatment of sewage is that it exactly follows the
processes of nature, in contradistinction to the mechanical
and chemical methods hitherto adopted.</p>

<p>At Sutton and some other places the same principles are
applied,&mdash;that is to say, bacterial filtration,&mdash;but there is no
tank. A metal screen in some measure takes its place, and
holds back solid matter from being carried on to the beds.
The filtrant is burnt clay, and it is forked over occasionally
to let in oxygen. The crude sewage is run over the top
of the burnt ballast, where it is left for two or three hours.
It is then slowly run off on to a finer filter, where it also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
stays two hours. Thence the effluent is run into the stream.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_b_094.jpg" width="400" height="397" alt="Filter-Beds as used at Sutton" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Filter-Beds</span><br />
<small>As Used at Sutton</small></p>
</div>

<p>It must be admitted that the bacterial treatment of sewage,
though exhibiting such excellent results where it has
been given a fair trial, is still in a probationary stage. It
appears to stand on reason. The sludge of previous methods
is avoided. The sewage is entirely broken down, and the effluent
is a comparatively pure one, yet taking back nitrogen,
as nitrate, to the soil. The whole change, indeed, in the
opinion of Dr. Dupré, is more effective and radical than in
chemical treatment. Further, it has been tested as regards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
its action upon the pathogenic bacilli&mdash;those of tubercle and
typhoid&mdash;with the result that these infective bacteria have
been completely destroyed. It appears that such destruction
of infective germs occurs in the tank, and depends in
degree upon the rapidity with which sewage is passed
through the tank. The cultivation beds also have an
inimical effect upon infective bacteria. Hence the final
effluent is practically germ-free as regards pathogenic
organisms.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br /><br />

<small><em>BACTERIA IN THE AIR</em></small></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap lowercase">METHODS OF EXAMINING AIR FOR BACTERIA</span></h3>

<p>The basis of the usual methods in practice is to pass air
over or through some nutrient medium. By this
means the contained organisms are waylaid, and finding
themselves under favourable conditions of pabulum, temperature,
and moisture, commence active growth, and thus
reveal themselves in characteristic colonies. These are
examined, as directed on page 43, by the microscope and
sub-culture. Quantitative estimation is not generally
made, as a fixed standard is even less a possibility than in
milk and soil. Returns of the number of bacteria in the
sample taken may be made for the sake of information, but
little or no conclusion of value can be drawn from such
data. The standard recognised in Europe is the cubic metre,
and one may speak, for example, of the air of a room containing
500, 1000, or 3000 germs per cubic metre.</p>

<p>The following are the chief methods:</p>

<p>1. <em>Pouchet's Aëroscope.</em> This apparatus was in use some
time ago in France, and by its means all the solid matter of
a given quantity of air was drawn through an air-tight glass
tube by aspiration and made to impinge upon a small plate
of glycerine. The air escaped to the aspirator at the sides,
leaving upon the glycerine plate only its particulate matter.
This remnant could then be examined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>

<p>2. <em>Koch</em> adopted the simplest of all the culture methods,
viz., exposing a plate of gelatine or agar for a longer or
shorter time to the air of which examination is desired. By
gravity the suspended bacteria fall on the plate and start
growth. As a matter of quantitative exactitude, this method
is not to be recommended, but it frequently proves an
excellent method for qualitative estimation.</p>

<p>3. <em>The Method of Miquel.</em> Pasteur was the first to analyse
air by the culture method, and he adopted a plan which in
principle is <em>washing</em> the air in some fluid culture medium
which will retain all the particulate matter, which may then
be cultured directly or sub-cultured into any favourable
medium.</p>

<p>Miquel has contrived a simple piece of apparatus for the
carrying out of this principle. It consists of a flask with a
<span class="figright200">
<img src="images/i_b_097.jpg" width="200" height="299" alt="Miquel's Flask" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Miquel's Flask</span></span></span>
central tube through its own neck
for the entrance of the air. On
one side of the flask is a tube to
be connected with the aspirator,
on the other side of the flask a
tube through which to pour off
the contained fluid at the end of
the process. In the flask are
placed 30 cc. of sterilised water
(or, indeed, if it be preferred,
sterilised broth). The entrance
tube is now unplugged, and the
aspirator draws through a fair
sample of the air in the room (say
ten litres). This air perforce
passes through the water and by
the exit tube to the aspirator, and
is thereby washed, leaving behind
in the water all its bacteria. The
aspiration is then stopped, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
entrance tube closed. The water (plus bacteria) is now
poured out into test-tubes of media or plated out on Petri's
dishes. Provided the apparatus has been absolutely sterilised,
and that the water was also sterile, any colonies
developing upon the Petri dish are composed of micro-organisms
from the air examined.</p>

<p>4. <em>The Method of Hesse.</em> This method is somewhat akin
to Pouchet's aëroscope, but is in addition a culture method.
Hesse's tube is about 2 feet long and 1-1/2 inches bore throughout.
At one end is an india-rubber stopper bored for a glass
tube to the aspirator. The other end is open. Before using,
the tube is sterilised, and 40 or 50 cc. of sterilised gelatine
replaced in it. The tube is now rapidly rotated in a groove
on a block of ice or under a cold-water tap, and by this
simple means the gelatine becomes fixed and forms a layer
inside the tube throughout. We have therefore, so to
speak, a tube of glass with a tube of gelatine inside it. The
apparatus is now ready for use. It is fixed on the tripod,
and fifteen litres of air are drawn through, and the tube is
properly plugged and incubated at room temperature. In
a day or two days the colonies appear upon the gelatine.
They are most numerous generally in the first part of the
tube, and might be roughly estimated as follows:</p>

<p>
15 litres of air, 6 colonies.<br />
<big>&#8258;</big> 6/15 × 10,000 = 4000 aërobic bacteria in the cubic metre.<br />
</p>

<p>The disadvantages of this process are that dried gelatine
does not catch germs like the broth cultures of Pasteur or
Miquel, and that many organisms are able to go straight
through the tube, and failing to be deposited, pass out at
the aspirator exit, and thus are neither caught nor counted.
The Hesse tube is generally used in practice with a pump
consisting of two flasks and a double-way india-rubber tube.
The flasks have a capacity for one litre of water. By a
simple adaptation it is possible to secure siphon action, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
hence measure with considerable exactitude the amount of
air passing through the tube.</p>

<p>5. <em>Methods of Filtration.</em> To-day most of the above
methods have been discarded, with the exception, perhaps,
of Miquel's and modifications thereof.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/i_b_099.jpg" width="300" height="64" alt="Sedgwick's Sugar-Tube" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Sedgwick's Sugar-Tube</span></p>
</div>

<p>Frankland, Petri, Pasteur, Sedgwick, and others have
suggested the adoption of methods of filtration. These
depend upon catching the organisms contained in the air by
filtering them through sterilised sand or sugar, and then
examining these media in the ordinary way. Many different
kinds of apparatus have been invented. Petri aspirates
through a glass tube containing sterilised sand, which after
use is distributed in Petri dishes and covered with gelatine.
The principal objection to this method is the presence of the
opaque particles of sand in and under the gelatine. Probably
it was this which suggested the use of soluble filters
like sugar. Pasteur introduced the principle, and Frankland
and others have followed it out. The apparatus most largely
used is that known as Sedgwick's Tube. This consists of
a comparatively small glass tube, about a foot long. Half
of it has a bore of 2.5 cm., and the other half a bore of .5
cm. It is sterilised at 150&deg;&nbsp;C., after which the dry, finely
granulated cane-sugar is inserted in such a way as to occupy
an inch or more of the narrow part of the tube next the
wide part. Next to it is placed a wool plug, and the whole
is again sterilised at 130&deg;&nbsp;C. for two hours, care being taken
that the sugar does not melt. After sterilisation an india-rubber
tube is fixed to the end of the narrow portion, and
thus it is attached to the aspirator. The measured quantity
(5&ndash;20 litres) of air is drawn through, and any particulate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
matter is caught in the sugar. Warm, nutrient gelatine
(10&ndash;15 cc.) is now poured into the broad end of the tube,
and by means of a sterilised stilette the sugar is pushed
down into the gelatine, where it quickly dissolves. We
have now in the gelatine all the micro-organisms in the air
which has been drawn through the tube. After plugging
with wool at both ends, the tube is <em>rolled</em> on ice or under
a cold-water tap in order to fix the gelatine all round the inner
wall of the tube, which is incubated at room tempera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>ture.
In a day or two the colonies appear, and may be
examined.</p>

<p><em>Micro-organisms in the Air.</em> Schwann was one of the first
to point out that when a decoction of meat is effectually
screened from the air, or supplied solely with calcined air,
putrefaction does not set in. Helmholtz and Pasteur confirmed
this, but it may be said with some truth that Schwann
originated the germ theory, and Lister applied it in the
treatment of wounds. Lister believed that if he could surround
wounds with filtered air the results would be as good
as if they were shut off from the air altogether.</p>

<p>It was Tyndall<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> who first laid down the general principles
upon which our knowledge of organisms in the air is based.
That the dust in the air was mainly organic matter, living
or dead, was a comparatively new truth; that epidemic disease
was not due to "bad air" and "foul drains," but to
germs conveyed in the air, was a prophecy as daring as it
was correct. From these and other like investigations it
came to be recognised that putrefaction begins as soon as
bacteria gain an entrance to the putrefiable substance, that
it progresses in direct proportion to the multiplication of
bacteria, and that it is retarded when they diminish or lose
vitality.</p>

<p>Tyndall made it clear that both as regards quantity and
quality of micro-organisms in the air there neither is nor
can be any uniformity. They may be conducted on particles
of dust&mdash;"the raft theory"&mdash;but being themselves
endowed with a power of flotation commensurate with their
extreme smallness and the specific lightness of their composition,
dust as a vehicle is not really requisite. Nevertheless
the estimation of the amount of dust present in a
sample of air is a very good index of danger. It is to Dr.
Aitken that we are indebted for devising a method by which
we can measure dust particles in the air, even though they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>be invisible. His ingenious experiments, reported in the
<cite>Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh</cite> (vol. xxxv.),
have demonstrated that by supersaturation of air the invisible
dust particles may become visible. As is now well
known, Dr. Aitken has been able to prove that fogs, mists,
and the like do not occur in dust-free air, and are due to
condensation of moisture upon dust particles. But it should
be remembered that, though dust forms a vehicle for bacteria,
dusty air is often comparatively free from bacteria.
Hence, after all, the necessary conditions for dissemination
of bacteria in air are two, namely, some degree of air-current
and dry surfaces.</p>

<p>This latter condition is one of essential importance. Bacteria
cannot leave a moist surface either under evaporation
or by means of air-currents.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> Only when there is considerable
molecular disturbance, such as splashing, can there
possibly be microbes transmitted to the surrounding air.
This fact, coupled with the influence of gravitation, is the
reason why sewer gas and all air contained within moist
perimeters is almost germ-free; whereas from dry surfaces
the least air-current is able to raise countless numbers of
organisms. Quite recently this principle has been admirably
illustrated in two series of investigations made upon
expired and inspired air. In a report to the Smithsonian
Institution of Washington (1895) upon the composition of
expired air, it is concluded that "in ordinary quiet respiration
no bacteria, epithelial scabs, or particles of dead tissue
are contained in the expired air. In the act of coughing or
sneezing such organisms or particles may probably be thrown
out." The interior of the cavity of the mouth and external
respiratory tract is a moist perimeter, from the walls of
which no organisms can rise except under molecular dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>turbance.
The position is precisely analogous to the
germ-free sewer air as established by Messrs. Laws and Andrewes
for the London County Council. The popular idea
that infection can be "given off by the breath" is contrary
to the laws of organismal pollution of air. The required
conditions are not fulfilled, and such breath infection must
be of extremely rare occurrence. The air can only be infective
when filled with organisms arising from dried surfaces.</p>

<p>The other series of investigations were conducted by Drs.
Hewlett and St. Clair Thompson, and dealt with the fate
of micro-organisms in inspired air and micro-organisms
in the healthy nose. They estimated that from 1500
to 14,000 bacteria were inspired every hour. Yet, as we
have pointed out, expired air contains practically none at
all. It is clear, then, that the inspired bacteria are detained
somewhere. Lister has pointed out, from observation
on a pneumo-thorax caused by a wound of the lung
by a fractured rib, that bacteria are arrested before they
reach the air-cells of the lung; hence it is at some intermediate
stage that they are detained. Hewlett and Thomson
examined the mucus from the wall of the trachea, and
found it germ-free. It was only when they reached the
mucous membrane and moist vestibules and vibriss&aelig; of the
nose that they found bacteria. Here they were present in
abundance. The ciliated epithelium, the moist mucus, and
the bactericidal influence of the wandering or "phagocyte"
cells probably all contribute to their final removal.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the large number of bacteria
present in the moist surfaces of the mouth is the cause of a
variety of ailments, and under certain conditions of ill-health
organisms may through this channel infect the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>body. <em>Dental caries</em> will occur to everyone's mind as a disease
possibly due to bacteria. As a matter of fact, probably
acids (due to acid secretion and acid fermentation) and
micro-organisms are two of the chief causes of decay of
teeth. Defects in the enamel, inherent or due to injury,
retention of débris on and around the teeth, and certain
pathological conditions of the secretion of the mouth are
predisposing causes, which afford a suitable nidus for putrefactive
bacteria. The large quantity of bacteria which a
decayed tooth contains is easily demonstrated.</p>

<p>From the two series of experiments which we have now
considered we may gather the following facts:</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) That air may contain great numbers of bacteria which
may be readily inspired.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) That <em>in health</em> those inspired do not pass beyond the
moist surface of the nasal and buccal cavities.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) That here there are various influences of a bactericidal
nature at work in defence of the individual.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) That expired air contains, as a rule, no bacteria whatever.</p>

<p>The practical application of these things is a simple one.
To keep air free from bacteria, the surroundings must be
moist. Strong acids and disinfectants are not required.
Moisture alone will be effectual. Two or three examples at
once occur to the mind.</p>

<p><em>Anthrax</em> spores are conveyed from time to time from
dried infected hides and skins to the hands or bodies of
workers in warehouses in Bradford and other places. If the
surroundings were moist, and the hides moist, anthrax
spores and all other bacteria would not remain free in the
air.</p>

<p>The bacilli or spores of <em>tubercle</em> present in sputum in great
abundance cannot, by any chance whatever, infect the air
until, and unless, the sputum dries. So long as the expectorated
matter remains on the pavement or handkerchief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
<em>wet</em>, the surrounding air will contain no bacilli of tubercle.
But when in the course of time the sputum dries, then the
least current of air will at once infect itself with the dried
spores and bacilli.</p>

<p><em>Typhoid Fever</em>, too, occupies the same position. Only
when the excrement dries can the contained bacteria infect
the air. It is of course well known that the common channel
of infection in typhoid fever is not the air, whereas
the reverse holds true of tuberculosis. The writer recently
obtained some virulent typhoid excrement, and placed it
in a shallow glass vessel under a bell-jar, with similar vessels
of sterilised milk and of water, all at blood-heat. So long
as the excrement remained moist, even though it soon lost
its more or less fluid consistence, the milk and water remained
uninfected. But when the excrement was completely
dried it required but a few hours to reveal typhoid
bacilli in the more absorptive fluid, milk, and at a later
stage the water also showed clear signs of pollution. This
evidence points in the same direction as that which has
gone before. If the excrement of patients suffering from
typhoid dries, the air will become infected; if, on the other
hand, it passes in a moist state into the sewer, even though
untreated with disinfectants, all will be well as regards the
surrounding air.</p>

<p>Before passing on to consider other matters concerning
organisms in the air, we may draw attention to some interesting
observations recorded by Mr. S. G. Shattock<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> on
the negative action of sewer air in raising the toxicity of
lowly virulent bacilli of diphtheria. Some direct relationship,
it has been surmised, exists between breathing sewer
air and "catching" diphtheria. Clearly it cannot be that
the sewer air contains the bacillus. But some have supposed
that the sewer air has had a detrimental effect by
increasing the virulent properties of bacilli already in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>human tissues. Two cultivations of lowly virulent bacilli
were therefore grown by Mr. Shattock in flasks upon a
favourable medium over which was drawn sewer air. This
was continued for two weeks or five weeks respectively. Yet
no increased virulence was secured. Such experiments require
ample confirmation, but even from this it will be seen
that sewer air does not necessarily have a favouring influence
upon the virulence of the bacilli of diphtheria.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the bacilli of diphtheria are capable
of lengthened survival outside the body, and are readily
disseminated by very feeble air-currents. The condition
necessary for their existence outside the body for any period
above two or three days is moisture. Dried diphtheria
bacilli soon lose their vitality. It is probably owing to this
fact that the disease is not as commonly conveyed by air as,
for example, tubercle.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p><em>The influence of gravity</em> upon bacteria in the air may be
observed in various ways, in addition to its action within a
limited area like a sewer or a room. Miquel found in some
investigations in Paris that, whereas on the Rue de Rivoli
750 germs were present in a cubic metre, yet at the summit
of the Pantheon only 28 were found in the same quantity
of air. At the tops of mountains air is germ-free, and bacteria
increase in proportion to descent. As Tyndall has
pointed out, even ultra-microscopic cells obey the law of
gravitation. This is equally true in the limited areas of a
laboratory or warehouse and in the open air.</p>

<p>The conditions which affect the number of bacteria in the
air are various. After a fall of rain or snow they are very
markedly diminished; during a dry wind they are increased.
In open fields, free from habitations, they are fewer, as
would be expected, than in the vicinity of manufactories,
houses, or towns. A dry, sandy soil or a dry surface of
any kind will obviously favour the presence of organisms in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>the air. Frankland found that fewer germs were present
in the air in winter than in summer, and that when the
earth was covered with snow the number was greatly reduced.
Miquel and Freudenreich have declared that the
number of atmospheric bacteria is greater in the morning
and evening between the hours of six and eight than during
the rest of the day. But we venture to express the hope
that such coincidental facts may not be exalted into principles.</p>

<p>There is no numerical standard for bacteria in the air as
there is in water. The open air possibly averages about 250
per cubic metre. On the seacoast this number would fall
to less than half; in houses and towns it would rise according
to circumstances, and frequently in dry weather reach
thousands per cubic metre. When it is remembered <em>that
air possesses no pabulum</em> for bacteria as do water and milk, it
will be understood that bacteria do not live in the air. They
are only driven by air-currents from one dry surface to
another. Hence the quality and quantity of air organisms
depend entirely upon environment and physical conditions.
In some researches which the writer made into the air of
workshops in Soho in 1896, it was instructive to observe
that fewer bacteria were isolated by Sedgwick's sugar-tube
in premises which appeared to the naked eye polluted in a
large degree than in other premises apparently less contaminated.
In the workroom of a certain skin-curer the
air was densely impregnated with particles from the skin,
yet scarcely a single bacterium was isolated. In the polishing-room
of a well-known hat firm, in which the air appeared
to the naked eye to be pure, and in which there was ample
ventilation, there were found four or five species of saprophytic
bacteria. Quite recently Mr. S. R. Trotman, public
analyst for the city of Nottingham, estimated the bacterial
quality of the air of the streets of that town during "the
goose fair" held in the autumn. He used a modification
of Hesse's apparatus in which the gelatine is replaced by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
glycerine. The air was slowly drawn through and measured
in the usual way. Sterilised water was then added to bring
the glycerine to a known volume, the liquid thoroughly
mixed, and a series of gelatine and agar plates made with
quantities varying from 0.1 to 2 cc. By this method a large
number of bacteria were detected in this particular investigation,
including <em>Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus et albus</em>,
the common <em>Bacillus subtilis</em>, and <em>B. coli communis</em>.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>During a six years' investigation the air of the Montsouris
Park yielded, according to Miquel, an average of 455 bacteria
per cubic metre. In the middle of Paris the average
per cubic metre was nearly 4000. Flügge accepts 100 bacteria
per cubic metre as a fair average. From this fact he
estimates that "a man during a lifetime of seventy years inspires
about 25,000,000 bacteria, the same number contained
in a quarter of a litre of fresh milk."<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> Many authorities
would place the average much below 100 per cubic metre,
but even if we accept that figure it is at once clear how
relatively small it is. This is due, as we have mentioned,
to sunlight, rain, desiccation, dilution of air, moist surfaces,
etc. So essentially does the bacterial content of air depend
upon the facility with which certain bacteria withstand drying
that Dr. Eduardo Germano<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> has addressed himself first
to drying various pathogenic species and then to mixing the
dried residue with sterilised dust and observing to what
degree the air becomes infected. Typhoid appears to withstand
comparatively little dessication, without losing its
virulence. Nevertheless, it is able to retain vitality in a
semi-dried condition, and it is owing to this circumstance
in all probability that it possesses such power of infection.
Diphtheria, on the other hand, is, as we have pointed out,
capable of lengthened survival outside the body, particularly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>when surrounded with dust. The question of their power
of resisting long drying is an unsettled point. The power of
surviving a drying process is, according to Germano, possessed
by the streptococcus. This is not the case with
cholera or plague. Dr. Germano classifies bacteria, as a
result of his researches, into three groups: first, those like
plague, typhoid, and cholera, which cannot survive drying
for more than a few hours; second, those like the bacilli of
diphtheria, and streptococci, which can withstand it for a
longer period; thirdly, those like tubercle, which can very
readily resist drying for months and yet retain their virulence.
It will be obvious that from these data it is inferred
that Groups 1 and 2 are rarely conveyed by the air, whereas
Group 3 is frequently so conveyed. Miquel has recently
demonstrated that soil bacteria or their spores can remain
alive in hermetically sealed tubes for as long a time as
sixteen years. Even at the end of that period the soil
inoculated into a guinea-pig produced tetanus.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>The presence of pathogenic bacteria in the air is, of
course, a much rarer contamination than the ordinary saprophytes.
Tubercle has been not infrequently isolated from
dry dust in consumption hospitals, and in exit ventilating
shafts at Brompton the bacillus has been found. From
dried sputum it has, of course, been many times isolated,
even after months of desiccation. M. Lalesque failed to
isolate it from the dry soil surrounding some garden seats
in a locality frequented by phthisical patients. The writer
also failed to isolate it from the same soil. But a very large
mass of experimental evidence attests the fact that the air
in proximity to dried tubercular sputum or discharges may
contain the specific bacillus of the disease. Diphtheria in
the same way, but in a lesser degree, may be isolated from
the air, and from the nasal mucous membrane of nurses,
attendants, and patients in a ward set apart for the treat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>ment
of the disease. Delalivesse, examining the air of wards
at Lille, found that the contained bacteria varied more or
less directly with the amount of floating matter, and depended
also upon the vibration set up by persons passing
through the ward and the heavy traffic in granite-paved
streets adjoining. <em>Bacillus coli</em>, staphylococci, and streptococci,
as well as <em>B. tuberculosis</em>, were isolated by this observer.</p>

<p>Some new light has been thrown upon the subject of
pathogenic organisms in air by Neisser in his investigations
concerning the amount and rate of air-currents necessary to
convey certain species through the atmosphere. He states
that the bacteria causing diphtheria, typhoid fever, plague,
cholera, and pneumonia, and possibly the common <em>Streptococcus
pyogenes</em>, are incapable of being carried by the molecules
of atmospheric dust which the ordinary insensible
currents of air can support, whilst <em>Bacillus anthracis</em>, <em>B.
pyocyaneus</em>, and the bacillus of tubercle are capable of being
aërially conveyed. This work will require further confirmation,
but if its truth be established, it proves that attempted
aërial disinfection of the first group of diseases is useless.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br /><br />

<small><em>BACTERIA AND FERMENTATION</em></small></h2>

<p>It was Pasteur who in 1857 first propounded the true cause
and process of fermentation. The breaking down of
sugar into alcohol and carbonic acid gas had been known,
of course, for a long period. Since the time of Spallanzani
(1776) the putrefactive changes in liquids and organic matter
had been prevented by boiling and subsequently sealing the
flask or vessel containing the fluid. Moreover, this successful
preventive practice had been in some measure correctly
interpreted as due to the exclusion of the atmosphere, but
wrongly credited to the exclusion of the oxygen of the air.
It was not until the beginning of the present century that
authorities modified their view and declared in favour of
yeast cells as the agents in the production of fermentation.
That this process was due to oxygen <em>per se</em> was disproved
by Schwann, who showed that so long as the oxygen admitted
to the flask of fermentative fluid was sterilised no
fermentation occurred. It was thus obvious that it was not
the atmosphere or the oxygen of the atmosphere, but some
fermenting agent borne into the flask by the admission of
unsterilised air. It was but a step to further establish this
hypothesis by adding unsterilised air plus some antiseptic
substance which would destroy the fermenting agent.
Arsenic was found by Schwann to have this germicidal
faculty. Hence Schwann supported Latour's theory that
fermentation was due to something borne in by the air, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
that this something was yeast. Passing over a number of
counter-experiments of Helmholtz and others, we come to
the work of Liebig. He viewed the transformation of sugar
into alcohol and carbonic acid gas simply and solely as a
non-vital chemical process, depending upon the dead yeast
communicating its own decomposition to surrounding elements
in contact with it.</p>

<p>Liebig insisted that all albuminoid bodies were unstable,
and if left to themselves would fall to pieces&mdash;<em>i. e.</em>, ferment&mdash;without
the aid of living organisms, or any initiative force
greater than dead yeast cells. It was at this juncture that
Pasteur intervened to dispel the obscurities and contradictory
theories which had been propounded.</p>

<p>As in all the conclusions arrived at by Pasteur, so in those
relating to fermentation, there were a number of different
experiments which were performed by him to elucidate the
same point. We will choose one of many in relation to
fermentation. If a sugary solution of carbonate of lime is
left to itself, after a time it begins to effervesce, carbonic
acid is evolved, and lactic acid is formed; and this latter
decomposes the carbonate of lime to form lactate of lime.
This lactic acid is formed, so to speak, at the expense of
the sugar, which little by little disappears. Pasteur demonstrated
the cause of this transformation of sugar into lactic
acid to be a thin layer of organic matter consisting of extremely
small moving organisms. If these be withheld or
destroyed in the fermenting fluid, fermentation will cease.
If a trace of this grey material be introduced into sterile
milk or sterile solution of sugar, the same process is set up,
and lactic acid fermentation occurs.</p>

<p>Pasteur examined the elements of this organic layer by
aid of the microscope, and found it to consist of small short
rods of protoplasm quite distinct from the yeast cells which
previous investigators had detected in alcoholic fermentation.
One series of experiments was accomplished with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
yeast cells and these bacteria, a second series with living
yeast cells only, a third series with bacteria only, and the
conclusions which Pasteur arrived at as the result of these
labours were as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"As for the interpretation of the group of new facts which
I have met with in the course of these researches, I am confident
that whoever shall judge them with impartiality will recognise
that the alcoholic fermentation is an act correlated to the life and
to the organisation of these corpuscles, and not to their death or
their putrefaction, any more than it will appear as a case of contact
action in which the transformation of the sugar is accomplished
in the presence of the ferment without the latter giving or taking
anything from it."</p></div>

<p>Pasteur occupied six years (1857&ndash;1863) with further elucidation
of his wonderful discovery of the potency of these
hitherto unrecognised agents, and the establishment of the
fact that "organic liquids do not alter until a living germ
is introduced into them, and living germs exist everywhere."</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that to Pasteur is due the whole
credit of the knowledge acquired respecting the cause of
fermentation. He did not first discover these living organisms;
he did not first study them and describe them; he
was not even the first to suggest that they were the cause
of the processes of fermentation or disease. But, nevertheless,
it was Pasteur who "first placed the subject upon a
firm foundation by proving with rigid experiment some of
the suggestions made by others." Thus it has ever been
in the times of new learning and discovery: many contributors
have added their quota to the mass of knowledge, even
though one man appearing at the right moment has drawn
the conclusions and proved the theory to be fact.</p>

<p>In order that no confusion may arise in the mind of the
reader, we may here say that, although fermentation is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
always due to a living agent, as proved by Pasteur, the
process is conveniently divided into two kinds.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> (1) When
the action is direct, and the chemical changes involved in
the process occur only in the presence of the cell, the latter
is spoken of as an <em>organised ferment</em>; (2) when the action is
indirect, and the changes are the result of the presence of a
soluble material secreted by the cell, acting apart from the
cell, this soluble substance is termed an <em>unorganised soluble
ferment</em>, or <em>enzyme</em>. The organised ferments are bacteria or
vegetable cells allied to the bacteria; the unorganised ferments,
or enzymes, are ferments found in the secretions of
specialised cells of the higher plants and animals. With the
former this book deals in an elementary fashion; with the
latter we have little concern. It will be sufficient to illustrate
the enzymes by a few of the more familiar examples.
They form, for example, the digestive agents in human assimilation.
This function is performed, in some cases, by the
enzyme combining with the substance on which it is acting
and then by decomposition yielding the new "digested"
substance and regenerating the enzyme; in other cases, the
enzyme, by its molecular movement, sets up molecular
movement in the substance it is digesting, and thus changes
its condition. These digestive enzymes are as follows: in
the saliva, <em>ptyalin</em>, which changes starch into sugar; in the
gastric juice of the stomach, <em>pepsin</em>, which digests the proteids
of the food and changes them into absorptive peptones;
the pancreatic ferments, <em>amylopsin</em>, <em>trypsin</em>, and
<em>steapsin</em>, capable of attacking all three classes of food stuffs;
and the intestinal ferments, which have not yet been separated
in purer condition. In addition to these, there are
ferments in bitter almonds, mustard, etc. Concerning
these unorganised ferments we have nothing further to say.
Perhaps the commonest of them all is <em>diastase</em>, which occurs
in malt, and to which some reference will be made later.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span></p>
<p>Its function is to convert the starch which occurs in barley
into sugar. These unorganised ferments act most rapidly
at about 75&deg;&nbsp;C. (167&deg;&nbsp;F.).<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p>We may now return to the work of Pasteur and the question
of <em>organised ferments</em>. Let us preface further remark
with an axiom with which Professor Frankland sums up the
vitalistic theory of fermentation, which was supported by
the researches of Pasteur: "<em>No fermentation without organisms,
in every fermentation a particular organism</em>." From
these words we gather that there is no one particular organism
or vegetable cell to be designated the micro-organism of
fermentation, but that there are a number of fermentations
each started by some specific form of agent. It is true that
the chemical changes induced by organised ferments depend
on the life processes of micro-organisms which feed
upon the sugar or other substance in solution, and excrete
the product of the fermentation. Fermentation nearly
always consists of a process of breaking down of complex
bodies, like sugar, into simpler ones, like alcohol and carbonic
acid. Of such fermentation we may mention at least
five: the <em>alcoholic</em>, by which alcohol is produced; the <em>acetous</em>,
by which wine absorbs oxygen from the air and becomes
vinegar; the <em>lactic</em>, which sours milk; the <em>butyric</em>, which out
of various sugars and organic acids produces butyric acid;
and <em>ammoniacal</em>, which is the putrefactive breaking down
of compounds of nitrogen into ammonia. We have already
referred at some length to this process when considering
denitrifying organisms in the soil.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span></p>
<p>There are four chief conditions common to all these five
kinds of organised fermentation. They are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The presence of the special living agent or organism of
the particular fermentation under consideration. This, as
Pasteur pointed out, differs in each case.</p>

<p>2. A sufficiency of pabulum (nutriment) and moisture to
favour the growth of the micro-organism.</p>

<p>3. A temperature at or about blood-heat (35&ndash;38&deg;&nbsp;C.,
98.5&deg;&nbsp;F.).</p>

<p>4. The absence from the solution or substance of any
obnoxious or inimical substances which would destroy or
retard the action of the living organism and agent. Many
of the products of fermentation are themselves antiseptics,
as in the case of alcohol; hence alcoholic fermentation
always arrests itself at a certain point.</p>

<p>We are now in a position to consider particular fermentations
and their causal micro-organisms. These latter are of
various kinds, belonging, according to botanical classification,
to various different subdivisions of the non-flowering
portion of the vegetable kingdom. A large part of fermentation
is based upon the growth of a class of microscopic
plants termed <em>yeasts</em>. These differ from the bacteria in but
few particulars, mainly in their method of reproduction by
budding (instead of dividing or sporulating, like the bacteria).
Their chemical action is closely allied to that of the
bacteria. Secondly, there are special fermentations and
modifications of yeast fermentation due to <em>bacteria</em>. Thirdly,
a group of somewhat more highly specialised vegetable cells,
known as <em>moulds</em>, make a perceptible contribution in this
direction. According to Hansen, these latter, so far as
they are really alcoholic ferments, induce fermentation, not
only in solutions of dextrose and invert sugar, but also in
solutions of maltose. <em>Mucor racemosus</em> is the only member
that is capable of inverting a cane-sugar solution; <em>M. erectus</em>
is the most active fermenter, yielding eight per cent. by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
volume of alcohol in ordinary beer wort. Each of these
will be referred to as they occur in considering the five important

<p>The general microscopic appearance of yeast cells may be
shortly stated as follows: they are round or oval cells, and
by budding become daughter yeasts. Each consists of a
membrane and clear homogeneous contents. As they perform
their function of fermentation, vacuoles, fat-globules,
and other granules make their appearance in the enclosed
plasma. As in many vegetable cells a <em>nucleus</em> was detected
by Schmitz by means of special methods of staining, Hansen
has found the nucleus in old yeast cells from "films"
without any special staining.</p>

<h3><small>1. <em>Alcoholic Fermentation.</em></small></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">Cause, yeast; medium, sugar solutions; result, alcohol and carbonic acid.</p></div>

<p>It was Caignard-Latour who first demonstrated that yeast
cells, by their growth and multiplication, set up a chemical
change in sugar solutions which resulted in the transference
of the oxygen from the hydrogen in the sugar compound to
the carbon atoms, that is to say, in the evolution of carbonic
acid gas and the production, as a result, of alcohol. If we
were to express this in a chemical formula, it would read as
follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span></p>

<p class="center">
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> (plus the yeast) = 2 C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O + 2 CO<sub>2</sub>.<br />
</p>

<p>A natural sugar, like grape-sugar, present in the fruit of
the vine, is thus fermented. The alcohol remains in the
liquid; the carbonic acid escapes as bubbles of gas into the
surrounding air. It is thus that brandy and wines are made.
If we go a step further back, to cane-sugar (which possesses
the same elements as grape-sugar, but in different proportions),
dissolve it in water, and mix it with yeast, we get
exactly the same result, except that the first stage of the
fermentation would be the changing of the cane-sugar into
grape-sugar, which is accomplished by a soluble ferment
secreted by the yeast cells themselves. If now we go yet
one step further back, to starch, the same sort of action
occurs. When starch is boiled with a dilute acid it is
changed into a gum-like substance named dextrin, and subsequently
into a sugar named maltose, which latter, when
mixed with these living yeast cells, is fermented, and results
in the evolution of carbonic acid gas and the production of
alcohol. In the manufacture of fermented drinks from
cereal grains containing starch there is therefore a double
chemical process: first the change of starch into sugar by
means of <em>conversion</em>,<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> and secondly the change of the sugar
into alcohol and carbonic acid gas by the process of <em>fermentation</em>,
an organic change brought about by the living
yeast cells.</p>

<p>In all these three forms of alcoholic fermentation the
principal features are the same, viz., the sugar disappears;
the carbonic acid gas escapes into the air; the alcohol remains
behind. Though it is true that the sugar disappears,
it would be truer still to say that it reappears as alcohol.
Sugar and alcohol are built up of precisely the same elements:
carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. They differ from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>each other in the proportion of these elements. It is
obvious, therefore, that fermentation is really only a change
of <em>position</em>, a breaking down of one compound into two
simpler compounds. This redistribution of the molecules
of the compound results in the production of some heat.
Thus we must add heat to the results of the work of the
yeasts.</p>

<p>When alcohol is pure and contains no water it is termed
<em>absolute alcohol</em>. If, however, it is mixed with 16 per cent.
of water, it is called <em>rectified spirit</em>, and when mixed with
more than half its volume of water (56.8 per cent.) it is
known as <em>proof spirit</em>.</p>

<p>We shall have to consider elsewhere a remarkable faculty
which some bacteria possess of producing products inimical
to their own growth. In some degree this is true of the
yeasts, for when they have set up fermentation in a saccharine
fluid there comes a time when the presence of the resulting
alcohol is injurious to further action on their part.
It has become indeed a poison, and, as we have already
mentioned, a necessary condition for the action of a ferment
is the absence of poisonous substances. This limit of fermentation
is reached when the fermenting fluid contains 13
or 14 per cent. of alcohol.</p>

<p>Having discussed shortly the "medium" and the results,
we may now turn to the bacteriology of the matter, and
enumerate some of the chief forms of the yeast plant. Professor
Crookshank<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> gives more than a score of different
members of this family of <em>Saccharomycetes</em>. Before dwelling
upon some of the chief of these, it will be desirable to consider
a number of properties common to the genus.</p>

<p>The yeast cell is a round or oval body of the nature of a
fungus, composed of granular protoplasm surrounded by a
definite envelope, or <em>capsule</em>. It reproduces itself by budding,
or, as it is sometimes termed, <em>gemmation</em>. At one end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>of the cell a slight swelling or protuberance appears, which
slowly enlarges. Ultimately there is a constriction, and the
bud becomes partly and at last completely separated from
the parent cell. In many cases the capsules of the daughter
cell and the parent cell adhere, thus forming a chain of
budding cells. The character of the cell and its method of
reproduction do not depend merely upon the particular
species alone, but are also dependent upon external circumstances.
There are differences in the behaviour of species
towards different media at various temperatures, towards the
carbohydrates (especially maltose), and in the chemical
changes which they bring about in nutrient liquids. In
connection with this Professor Hansen has pointed out that,
whilst some species can be made use of in fermentation
industries, others cannot, and some even produce diseases
in beer.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Ascospore Formation</span></p>
</div>

<p>One of the most remarkable evidences of the adaptability
of the yeasts to their surroundings and a specific characteristic
occurs in what is sometimes called <em>ascospore</em> formation.
If a yeast cell finds itself lacking nourishment or in an unfavourable
medium, it reproduces itself not by budding, but
by forming spores out of its own intrinsic substance, and
within its own capsule. To obtain this kind of spore formation
Hansen used some gypsum blocks as medium on which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>to grow his yeast cells. Well-baked plaster of Paris is
mixed with distilled water, and made into a liquid paste.
Small moulds are made by pouring this paste into cardboard
dishes, where it hardens again. The mould is sterilised
by heat, and a small portion of yeast is placed on its
upper surface, and then the whole is floated in a small vessel
of water and covered with a bell-jar. Under these conditions
of limited pabulum the cell undergoes the following
changes: it increases in size, loses much of its granularity,
and becomes homogeneous, and about thirty hours after
being sown on the gypsum there appear several refractile
cells inside the parent cell. These are the ascospores. In
addition to the gypsum, it is necessary to have a plentiful
supply of oxygen, some moisture (gained from the vessel of
water in which the gypsum floats), a certain temperature,
and a young condition of the protoplasm of the parent yeast
cells. Hansen found that the lowest temperature at which
these ascospores were produced was .5&ndash;3&deg;&nbsp;C., and at the
other extreme up to 37&deg;&nbsp;C., which is blood-heat. The
rapidity of formation also varies with the temperature, the
favourable degree of warmth being about 22&ndash;25&deg;&nbsp;C.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/i_b_121.jpg" width="250" height="159" alt="Gypsum Block" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Gypsum Block</span></p>
</div>

<p>Hansen pointed out that it was possible by means of
sporulation to differentiate species of yeasts. For it happens
that different species show slight differences in spore
formation, <em>e. g.</em>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span></p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) The spores of <em>Saccharomyces cerevisi&aelig;</em> expand during
the first stage of germination, and produce partition walls,
making a compound cell with several chambers. Budding
can occur at any point on the surface of the swollen spores.
To this group belong <em>S. pastorianus</em> and <em>S. ellipsoideus</em>.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) The spores of <em>Saccharomyces Ludwigii</em> fuse in the first
stage, and afterwards grow out into a promycelium, which
produces yeast cells.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) The spores of <em>Saccharomyces anomalus</em> are different in
shape from the others in that they possess a projecting rim
round the base.</p>

<p>Another point in the cultivation of yeasts has been elucidated
by a number of workers, chief among whom perhaps
is Hansen, namely, methods of obtaining <em>pure cultures</em>. We
know, generally speaking, what this term means, and there
is no difference in its meaning here to what is understood as
its meaning with regard to bacteria. There is, however,
some difference in the mode of securing it. It is only by
starting with one individual cell that we can hope to secure
a pure culture of yeasts. For the study of the morphology
of yeasts under the microscope the problem was not a difficult
one. It was comparatively easy to keep out foreign
germs from a cover-glass preparation enough to perceive
germination of spores and growth of mycelium. But when
we require pure cultures for various physiological purposes,
then a different standard and method are necessary.</p>

<p><br />Pasteur and Cohn adopted a practice based upon the fact
that when organisms find themselves in a favourable medium
they multiply to the exclusion of others to which the medium
is less favourable. Hence if an impure mixture be placed
under such circumstances there comes a time when those
organisms for which the circumstances are favourable multiply
to such an extent that they form an almost pure culture.
The method is open to fallacy, and will rarely result
in a really pure culture; and even if that be secured, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>quite possible that it will be to the exclusion of the desired
culture. Hansen has devised a much improved process for
securing a pure culture of yeast which depends upon dilution.
We believe Lister was one of the first who, in the
seventies, introduced some such plan as this. Hansen employed
dilution with water in the following manner:</p>

<p>Yeast is diluted with a certain amount of sterilised water.
A drop is carefully examined under the microscope, a single
cell of yeast is taken, and a cultivation made upon wort.
When it has grown abundantly a quantity of sterilised water
is added. From this, again, a single drop is taken and
added, to, say 20 cc. of sterilised water in a fresh flask. This
flask will contain we will suppose ten cells. It is now vigorously
shaken, and the contents are divided into twenty portions
of 1 cc. each, and added to twenty tubes of sterilised
water. It is highly probable that half of those tubes have
received one cell each. In the course of a few days it can
be seen how far a culture is pure. If only one colony is
present, the culture is a pure one, and as this grows we
obtain an absolutely pure culture in necessary quantity.
Even when the gelatine-plate method is used it is desirable
to start with a single cell (Hansen). The advantage of
Hansen's yeast method over Koch's bacterial-plate method
is that it has a certain definite starting-point. This is
obviously impossible when dealing with such microscopic
particles as the bacteria proper.</p>

<p>A third matter in the differentiation of yeast species is
the question of <em>films</em>. Hansen set to work, after having
obtained pure cultures and ascospores, to examine films appearing
on the surface of liquids undergoing fermentation.
The object of this was to ascertain whether all yeasts produced
the same mycelial growth on the surface of the
fermenting fluid. To produce these films the process is as
follows: Drop on to the surface of sterilised wort in a flask
a very small quantity of a pure culture of yeast; secure the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
flask from movement, and protect it, not from air, which is
necessary, but from falling particles in the air. In a short
time small colonies appear, which coalesce and form patches,
then a film or membrane which covers the liquid and attaches
itself to the sides of the flask. By the differences in the
films and the temperatures at which they form it is possible
to obtain something of a basis for classification. The further
advances in a yeast culture and in our knowledge of the agencies
of fermentation have, however, tended to show that no
strict dividing lines can be drawn. Hansen's researches have,
notwithstanding, been of the greatest moment to the whole
industry of fermentation. What has been found true in
bacteriology has also been demonstrated in fermentation,
namely, that though many yeasts differ but little in structure
and behaviour, they may produce very different products
and possess very different properties. Industrial cultivation
of these finer differences in fermentative action has to a large
extent revolutionised the brewing industry.</p>

<p>The formation of films is not a peculiarity of certain
species, but must be regarded as a phenomenon occurring
somewhat commonly amongst yeasts. The requisites are
a suitable medium, a yeast cell, a free, still surface, direct
access of air, and a favourable temperature. The wort loses
colour, and becomes pale yellow. Microscopic differences
soon appear between the sedimentary yeast and the film
yeast of the same species, the latter growing out into long
mycelial forms, the character of which depends in part upon
the temperature. This often varies from 3&deg; to 38&deg;&nbsp;C.</p>

<p>A fourth point helpful in diagnosis is the temperature
which proves to be the thermal death-point. <i>Saccharomyces
cerevisi&aelig;</i> is killed by an exposure to 54&deg;&nbsp;C. for five minutes,
and 62&deg;&nbsp;C. kills the spores. As a rule, yeasts can resist a
considerably higher temperature when in a dry state than
in the presence of moisture.</p>

<p>Lastly, yeasts may be cultivated on solid media. Hansen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
employed wort-gelatine (5 per cent. gelatine), and found
that at 25&deg;&nbsp;C. in a fortnight the growths which develop
show such microscopic differences as to aid materially in
diagnosis. <em>Saccharomyces ellipsoideus I.</em> exhibits a characteristic
network which readily distinguishes it.</p>

<p>There is one other point to which reference must be
made. The process of fermentation may be set up by a
"high" or a "low" yeast. These terms apply to the
temperature at which the process commences. "High"
yeasts rise to the surface as the action proceeds, accomplish
their work rapidly, and at a comparatively high temperature,
say about 16&deg;&nbsp;C.; "low" yeasts, on the contrary,
sink in the fermenting fluid, act slowly, and only at the low
temperature of 4&deg; or 5&deg;&nbsp;C. This is maintainable by floating
ice in the fluid. Formerly all beer was made by the
"high" mode, but on the continent of Europe "low"
yeast is mostly used, while the "high" is in vogue in England.
This latter method is more conducive to the development
of extraneous organisms, and therefore risky in all but
well-ordered brewing establishments. Whether high and
low yeasts consist of one or several species is not known.</p>

<p>Before proceeding to mention shortly some of the commoner
forms of yeast we must again emphasise Hansen's
method of analysis in separating a species. The shape,
size, and appearance of cells are not sufficient for differentiation,
because it is found that the same species when exposed
to different external conditions can occur in very
different forms. Hence Hansen established the analytical
method of observing (1) the microscopic appearance, (2) the
formation of ascospores, and (3) the formation of films. In
addition, the temperature limits, cultivation on solid media,
and behaviour towards carbohydrates, are characters which
aid in the separation of yeasts. By basing differentiation
of species upon these features, the following can be distinguished:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<p><em>Saccharomyces Cerevisi&aelig;.</em> Oval or ellipsoidal cells; reproduction
by budding; ascospores, rapidly at 30&deg;&nbsp;C., slowly
at 12&deg;&nbsp;C., not formed at all at lower temperatures; film
formation, seven to ten days at 22&deg;&nbsp;C.; an active alcoholic
ferment, producing in a fortnight in beer wort from 4 to 6
per cent. by volume of alcohol (Jörgensen). This species
is a typical English "high" yeast, possessing the power
of "inverting" cane-sugar previous to producing alcohol
and carbonic acid. It is said to have no action on
milk-sugar.</p>

on the surface of wort-gelatine, a network is produced by
which they can be recognised (in eight to twelve days at
33&deg;&nbsp;C.). At 13&ndash;15&deg;&nbsp;C. a characteristic branching mass is
produced. It is an alcoholic ferment as active as <em>S. cerevisi&aelig;</em>.
<em>S. Ellipsoideus II.</em> Round and oval, rarely elongated,
a widely distributed yeast, causing "muddiness" in
beer and a bitter taste. It is essentially a "low" yeast.</p>

<p>If alcohol be diluted with water, and the specific ferment
mixed with it and exposed to the air at 22&deg;&nbsp;C., it is rapidly
converted into vinegar. The change is accompanied by the
absorption of oxygen, one atom of which combines with
two of hydrogen to form water, and a substance remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
called <em>aldehyde</em>, further oxidation of which produces the
acetic acid. We may express it chemically thus:</p>

<table summary="oxidation of which produces the
acetic acid."><tr>
<td class="tdl">Alcohol.</td><td class="tdr">Aldehyde.    Water.<br /></td>
</tr><tr>
<td class="tdc" colspan="2">C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O (+ oxygen and the ferment) = C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub>O.</td>
</tr></table>

<p>The aldehyde becomes further oxidised:</p>

<p class="center">
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O + O = C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (acetic acid).<br />
</p>

<p>Now this method of simply oxidising alcohol to obtain
acetic acid may be carried out chemically without any ferment.
If slightly diluted alcohol be dropped upon <em>platinum
black</em>, the oxygen condensed in that substance acts with
energy upon the spirit, and union readily occurring, acetic
acid results. Here the whole business of the platinum
sponge is to persuade the oxygen of the air and the hydrogen
of the alcohol to unite. In the ordinary manufacture
this is accomplished by the vegetable cells of <em>Mycoderma
aceti</em>.</p>

<p>There are two chief methods adopted in the commercial
manufacture of vinegar, both of which depend upon the
presence of the <em>Mycoderma</em>. The method in vogue at
Orleans when Pasteur (about 1862) commenced his studies
of the vinegar organism was to fill vats nearly to the brim
with a weak mixture of vinegar and wine. Where the process
is proceeding the surface is covered with a fragile
pellicle, "the mother of vinegar," which is produced by
and consists of certain micro-organisms whose function is
to convey the oxygen of the air to the liquor in the vats,
thus oxidising the alcohol into vinegar. This oxidation
may be carried on even beyond the stage of acetic acid
(when no more alcohol remains to be oxidised), resulting in
carbonic acid gas, which escapes into the air. But as in the
alcoholic, so in the acetic, fermentation, there comes a time
when the presence of an excess of the acid inhibits the
further growth of the organism. This point is approxim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>ately
when the acetic acid has reached a percentage as high
as 14. But if the acid be removed, and fresh alcohol added,
the process recommences.</p>

<p>The second method, sometimes called by the Germans
the "quick vinegar process," is to pour the weakened
alcohol through a tall cylinder filled with wood-shavings,
having first added some warm vinegar to the shavings.
After a number of hours the resulting fluid is charged with
acetic acid. What has occurred? Liebig maintained that
a chemical and mechanical change had brought about the
change from the alcohol put into the cylinder and the vinegar
drawn off at the exit tube. It was reserved for Pasteur
to demonstrate by experiment that the addition of the warm
vinegar to the shavings was in reality an addition of a living
micro-organism, which, forming a film upon the shavings,
became "the mother of vinegar," and oxidised the alcohol
which passed over it, inducing it to become aldehyde and
then acetic acid.</p>

<p><em>Mycoderma Aceti</em> (described by Persoon 1822, Kützing
1837, and Pasteur 1864). It must be understood that this
term is the name rather of a family than an individual.
Pasteur believed it to be a specific individual, but Hansen
pointed out that it was composed of two distinctly different
species (<em>Bacterium aceti</em> and <em>B. pasteurianum</em>), and subsequently
other investigators have added members to the
acetic fermentation group of which <em>M. aceti</em> is the type.</p>

<p>This bacterium is made up of small, slightly elongated
cells, with a transverse diameter of 2 or 3 µ, sometimes
united in short chains of curved rods. They frequently
show a central constriction, are motile, and produce in old
cultures involution forms. The way in which the cells act
and are made to perform their function is as follows: A
small quantity, taken from a previous pellicle, is sown on
the surface of an aqueous liquid, containing 2 per cent. of
alcohol, 1 per cent. of vinegar, and traces of alkaline phos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>phates.
Very rapidly indeed the little isolated colonies
spread, and, becoming confluent, form a membrane or pellicle
over the whole area of fluid. When the surface is covered
the alcohol acidifies to vinegar. After this it is necessary
to add each day small quantities of alcohol. When the
oxidation is completed the vinegar is drawn off, and the
membrane is collected and washed, and is then again ready
for use. It ought not to remain long out of fermenting
liquid, nor ought it to be allowed to over-perform its function,
for thus having oxidised all the alcohol it will commence
oxidation of the vinegar.</p>

<p>In wort-gelatine <em>Bacterium pasteurianum</em> develops round
colonies with a smooth or wavy border, whilst <em>B. aceti</em> has a
tendency towards stellate arrangement. Spores have not
been observed, and from a morphological point of view the
two species behave alike. Neither produces any turbidity
in the liquid containing them. In order to flourish, <em>B.
aceti</em> requires a temperature of about 33&deg;&nbsp;C. and a plentiful
supply of oxygen. In a cool store or cellar there is, therefore,
nothing to fear from <em>B. aceti</em>. Frankland has isolated
a <em>Bacillus ethaceticus</em>, which is a fermentative organism producing
ethyl-alcohol and acetic acid. By oxidation the
ethyl-alcohol may be converted into acetic acid.</p>

<h3><small>3. <em>Lactic Acid Fermentation.</em></small></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">Cause, Bacillus acidi lactici; medium, milk-sugar, cane-sugar, glucose,
dextrose, etc.; result, lactic acid.</p></div>

<p>The process set up by the lactic ferment is simply a decomposition,
an exact division of one molecule of sugar into
two molecules of lactic acid, there being neither oxidation
nor hydration. The conditions under which the ferment
acts are very similar to those we have already considered.
There is frequently carbonic acid gas formed; there is a
cessation of fermentation when the medium becomes too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
acid; there is the same method of starting the process by
inoculation of sour milk or cheese or any substance containing
the specific bacillus. It is probable that such inoculated
matter will contain a mixture of micro-organisms, but if the
lactic bacillus is present, it will grow so vigorously and
abundantly that the fermentation will be readily set up.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_b_131.jpg" width="200" height="169" alt="B. Acidi Lactici" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">B. Acidi Lactici</span></p></div>

<p><em>The Bacillus Acidi Lactici.</em> Rods about 2 µ long and 4 µ
wide, occurring singly or in chains and threads. It is non-motile.
Spore formation is present, the spores appearing
irregularly or at one end of the rod.</p>

<p>On the surface of gelatine a delicate growth appears along
the track of the needle, with round colonies appearing at the
edges of the growth. It does not liquefy gelatine. It
grows best at blood-heat; but much above that it fails to
produce its fermentation, and it ceases to grow under 10&deg;&nbsp;C.
It inverts milk-sugar and changes it to dextrose, from which
it then produces lactic acid. Sugars do, however, differ
considerably in the degrees to which they respond to the
influence of the lactic ferment, and some which are readily
changed by the alcoholic ferment are untouched by the
<em>Bacillus acidi lactici</em>. It will be necessary to refer again to
this micro-organism when we come to speak of milk and
other dairy products.</p>

<p>Van Laer has described a saccharobacillus which produces
lactic acid amongst other products, and brings about a
characteristic disease in beer, named <em>tourne</em>. The liquid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
gradually loses its brightness and assumes a bad odour and
disagreeable taste. The bacillus is a facultative anaërobe.
A number of workers have separated organisms, having a
lactic acid effect, which diverge considerably from the
orthodox type of lactic acid bacillus. This is but further
evidence of a fact to which reference has been made: that
nomenclature restricted to one individual has now become
adapted to a family.</p>

<h3><small>4. <em>Butyric Acid Fermentation.</em></small></h3>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">Cause, Bacillus butyricus and B. amylobacter; medium, milk, butter, sugar
and starch solutions, glycerine; result, butyric acid.</p></div>

<p>When sugars are broken down by the <em>Bacillus acidi lactici</em>
the lactic acid resulting may, under the influence of the
butyric ferment, become converted into butyric acid, carbonic
acid, and hydrogen. Neither butyric acid nor lactic
acid is as commonly used as alcohol or vinegar. Both, like
vinegar, can be manufactured chemically, but this is rarely
practised. Butyric acid is a common ingredient in old milk
and butter, and its production by bacteria is historically
one of the first bacterial fermentations understood. Moreover,
in its investigation Pasteur first brought to light the
fact that certain organisms acted only in the absence of
oxygen. In studying a drop of butyric fermenting fluid, it
was observed that the organisms at the edge of the drop
were motionless and apparently dead, whilst in the central
portion of the drop the bacilli were executing those active
movements which are characteristic of their vitality. To
Pasteur's mind this at once suggested what he was able later
to demonstrate, namely, that these bacilli were paralysed by
contact with oxygen. When he passed a stream of air
through a flask containing a liquid in butyric fermentation,
he observed the process slacken and eventually cease. So
were discovered the <em>anaërobic</em> micro-organisms. The aërobic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
ferments give rise to oxidation of certain products of decomposition;
the anaërobic organisms, on the other hand, only
commence to grow when the aërobic have used up all the
available oxygen. Thus in such fermentations certain bodies
(carbohydrates, fatty acids, etc.) undergo decomposition, and
by oxidation become carbonic acid gas, and the remainder is
left as a "reduced" product of the whole process. Hence
sometimes this is termed fermentation by reduction. The
chemical formula of this butyric reaction may be expressed
thus:&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Bacillus Butyricus.</em> Long and short rods, generally
straight, with rounded ends, single or in chains, reproducing
themselves both by fission and spores, and sometimes
growing out into long threads, actively motile, anaërobic,
and liquefying. The spores are widely distributed in
nature, and grow readily on fleshy roots, old cheese, etc.
The favourable temperature is blood-heat, and on liquid
media they produce a pellicle. The resistant spores are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
irregularly placed in the rod, and may cause considerable
variations in morphology. The culture gives off a strong
butyric acid odour. It grows most readily at a temperature
of about 40&deg;&nbsp;C.</p>

<p>Although, according to Pasteur's researches, the butyric
acid ferment performs its functions anaërobically, many
butyric organisms can act in the presence of oxygen, and
yield somewhat different products.</p>

<p>All of them, however, ferment most actively at a temperature
at or about blood-heat, and the spores are able to
withstand boiling for from three to twenty minutes (Fitz).
It will be observed that as in lactic acid fermentation so in
butyric, the results are not due to one species only.</p>

<h3><small>5. <em>Ammoniacal Fermentation</em> (see under Soil).</small></h3>

<p><em>Diseases in Beer.</em> We have seen how a knowledge of fermentation
has been compiled by a large number of workers.
Spallanzani, Schwann, Pasteur, and Hansen all made epoch-making
contributions. In the same way the investigations
of diseases in beers and wines were carried out by many observers,
and were closely connected with those relating to
spontaneous generation and mixed cultures of bacteria in
fermentation. These so-called "diseases" are analogous
to the taints occurring in milk and due to fermentations.
Turning (<em>tourne</em>), turbidity, ropiness, bitterness, acidity,
mouldiness, are all terms used to describe these diseases.
They are chiefly brought about by four agencies:&mdash;</p>

<p>
1. Bacteria.<br />
2. Mixed yeasts.<br />
3. "Wild" yeasts.<br />
4. Moulds.<br />
</p>

<p>To each species of wild yeast there belongs some taint-producing
power in the fermentations for which it is responsible.
<em>Saccharomyces ellipsoideus II.</em> and <em>S. pastorianus I.</em>,
<em>III.</em>, are such yeasts; they only produce their diseases when
introduced at the commencement of the fermentation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<p><em>Saccharomyces pastorianus I.</em> is a low fermentative yeast
in elongated cells, producing a <em>bitter</em> taste to beer and an
unpleasant odour. It can also produce turbidity. <em>S. pastorianus
III.</em> produces turbidity, and <em>S. ellipsoideus II.</em> has a
similar effect.</p>

<p>In 1883 Hansen demonstrated that the much-dreaded
turbidity and disagreeable tastes and smells in beer may be
due to mixture of two yeasts, each of which by itself gives
a faultless product.</p>

<p><em>Industrial Application of Bacterial Ferments.</em> From what
has been said we trust it has been made evident that bacteriology
has a place of ever-increasing importance in regard
to fermentative processes. Not only have the causal agents
of various fermentations been isolated and studied, but from
their study practical results follow. The question of pure
cultures alone is one of practical importance; the recognition
of the causes of "diseases" of beer is another.</p>

<p>We cannot enter into a full discussion of the rôle of bacteria
in industrial processes, but several of the chief directions
may be pointed out. Without exception, bacteria have a
part in them on account of their powers of fermentation. In
securing their food, bacteria break down material, and bring
about chemical and physical change. The power which
organisms have of chemically destroying compounds is in
itself of little importance, but the products which arise as a
result are of an importance in the world which has not
hitherto been recognised. We have used bacteria abundantly
in the past, but we have not perceived that we were
doing so. <em>The maceration industries</em> may be mentioned as
illustrative of this use without acknowledgment. The flax
stem is made up of cellular substance, flax fibres, and wood
fibres; the later are of no service in the making of linen, but
the whole is bound together by a gummy, resinous substance.
Now this connective element is got rid of in the
process of <em>retting</em>. There is dew-retting and water-retting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
The former is practised in Russia, and consists in spreading
the flax on the grass and exposing it to the influence of dew,
rain, air, and light. The result is a soft and silky fibre.
Water-retting is accomplished by means of steeping the flax
in bundles, roots downwards, in tanks or ponds. In ten to
fourteen days, according to the weather, fermentation sets
in, and breaks the "shore" or "shive" from the fibre, and
the process is complete. This is always done by the aid
of bacteria, which, under the favourable circumstances, multiply
rapidly, and cause decomposition of the pectin resinous
matter. The same operation occurs in <em>jute</em> and <em>hemp</em>.
<em>Sponges</em>, too, are cleared in this manner by the rotting of
the organic matter in their interstices. The preparation of
<em>indigo</em> from the indigo plant is brought about by a special
bacterium found on the leaves. If the leaves are sterilised,
no fermentation occurs, and no indigo is formed. <em>Tobacco-curing</em>
is also in part due to decomposition bacteria, and
several bacteriologists have experimented independently in
fermenting tobacco leaves by the action of pure cultures
obtained from tobacco of the finest quality.</p>

<p>In all these applications we have advanced only the first
stage of the journey. Nevertheless, here, as in nature on a
big scale in the formation of fertile soils and coal-measures,
we find bacteria silently at work, achieving great ends by
co-operating in countless hordes.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br /><br />

<small><em>BACTERIA IN THE SOIL</em></small></h2>

<p>Surface soils and those rich in organic matter supply
a varied field for the bacteriologist. Indeed, it may
be said that the introduction of the plate method of culture
and the improved facilities for growing anaërobic micro-organisms
have opened up possibilities of research into soil
microbiology unknown to previous generations of workers.</p>

<p>From the nature of bacteria it will be readily understood
that their presence is affected by geological and physical
conditions of the soil, and in all soils only within a few feet
of the surface. As we go down below two feet, bacteria
become less, and below a depth of five or six feet we find
only a few anaërobes. At a depth of ten feet, and in the
"ground water region," bacteria are scarce or absent. This
is held to be due to the porosity of the soil acting as a filtering
medium. Regarding the numbers of micro-organisms
present in soil, no very accurate standard can be obtained.
Ordinary earth may yield anything from 10,000 to 5,000,000
per gram, whilst from polluted soil even 100,000,000 per
gram have been estimated. These figures are obviously
only approximate, nor is an exact standard of any great
value. Nevertheless, Fränkel, Beumer, Miquel, and Maggiora
have, as the result of experiments, arrived at a number
of conclusions respecting bacteria in soil which are of
much more practical use. From these results it appears
that, in addition to the "ground water region" being free,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
or nearly so, virgin soils contain much fewer than cultivated
lands, and these latter, again, fewer than made soils and
inhabited localities. In cultivated lands the number of
organisms augments with the activity of cultivation and the
strength of the fertilisers used. In all soils the maximum
occurs in July and August.</p>

<p>But the condition which more than all others controls the
quantity and quality of the contained bacteria is the degree
and quality of the organic matter in the soil. The quantity
of organic matter present in soil having a direct effect upon
bacteria will be materially increased by placing in soil the
bodies of men and animals after death. Dr. Buchanan
Young two or three years ago performed some experiments
to discover to what degree the soil bacteria were affected by
these means. "The number of micro-organisms present in
soil which has been used for burial purposes," he concludes,
"exceeds that present in undisturbed soil at similar level,
and this excess, though apparent at all depths, is most
marked in the lower reaches of the soil."<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> The numbers
were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p style="margin-left: 1em;">
Virgin soil, 4 ft. 6 in. = 53,436 m.o. per gram of soil.<br />

<span class="h">Burial</span>"<span class="h">lsoil</span>(3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), 6 ft. 6 in. = 722,751<span class="h">m.o. pe</span>"<span class="h">per gra</span>"
</p></div>

<p><em>Methods of Examination of Soil.</em> Two simple methods are
generally adopted. The first is to obtain a qualitative estimation
of the organisms contained in the soil. It consists
simply in adding to test-tubes of liquefied gelatine or broth
a small quantity of the sample, finely broken up with a
sterile rod. The test-tubes are now incubated at 37&deg;&nbsp;C. and
22&deg;&nbsp;C., and the growth of the contained bacteria observed
in the test-tube, or after a plate culture has been made.
The second plan is adopted in order to secure more accurate
quantitative results. One gram or half-gram of the sample
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>is weighed on the balance, and then added to 1000 cc. of
distilled sterilised water in a sterilised flask, in which it is
thoroughly mixed and washed. From either of these two
different sources it is now possible to make sub-cultures and
plate cultures. The procedure is, of course, that described
under the examination of water (p. 41 <em>et seq.</em>), and Petri's
dishes, Koch's plates, or Esmarch's roll cultures are used.
Many of the commoner bacteria in soil will thus be detected
and cultivated. But it is obvious that this by no means
covers the required ground. It will be necessary for us here
to consider the methods generally adopted for growing anaërobic
bacteria, that is to say those species which will not
grow in the presence of oxygen. This anaërobic difficulty
may be overcome in a variety of ways.</p>

<p>1. The air contained in the culture tube may be removed
by <em>ebullition</em> and rapid cooling. And whilst this may accurately
produce a vacuum, it is far from easy to introduce
the virus without also reintroducing oxygen.</p>

<p>2. The oxygen may be displaced by some other gas, and
though coal-gas, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide may all be
used for this purpose, it has become the almost universal
practice to grow anaërobes in <em>hydrogen</em>. The production of
the hydrogen is readily obtained by Kipp's or some other
suitable apparatus for the generation of hydrogen from zinc
and sulphuric acid. The free gas is passed through various
wash-bottles to purify it of any contaminations. Lead
acetate (1&ndash;10 per cent. water) removes any traces of sulphuretted
hydrogen, silver nitrate (1&ndash;10) doing the same for
arseniated hydrogen; whilst a flask of pyrogallic acid will
remove any oxygen. It is not always necessary to have
these three purifiers if the zinc used in the Kipp's apparatus is
pure. Occasionally a fourth flask is added of distilled water,
and this or a dry cotton wool pledget in the exit tube will
ensure germ-free gas. From the further end of the exit
tube of the Kipp's apparatus an india-rubber tube will carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
the hydrogen to its desired destination. With some it is the
custom to place anaërobic cultures in test-tubes, and the
test-tubes in a large flask having a two-way tube for entrance
and exit of the hydrogen; others prefer to pass the
hydrogen immediately into a large test-tube containing
the culture (Fränkel's method).
Either method ends practically
the same, and the growth of
the culture in hydrogen is readily
observed. Yet another plan
is to use a yeast flask, and after
having passed the hydrogen
through for about half an hour,
the lateral exit tube is dipped
into a small flask containing
mercury. The entrance tube is
now sealed, and the whole apparatus
placed in the incubator. The interior containing
the culture is filled with an atmosphere of hydrogen. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
oxygen can obtain entrance through the sealed entrance
tube, or through the exit tube immersed in mercury. Yet
through this latter channel any gases produced by the culture
could escape if able to produce sufficient pressure.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Kipp's Apparatus</span><br />
<small>For the Production of Hydrogen</small></p></div>

<p>3. <em>The Absorption Method.</em> Instead of adding hydrogen
to the tube or flask containing the anaërobic culture, it is
<span class="figleft150">
<img src="images/i_b_141a.jpg" width="150" height="311" alt="Fränkel's Tube" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fränkel's Tube</span><br />
<small>For Cultivation of Anaërobes</small></span></span>
feasible to add to the medium
some substances, like glucose
<span class="figright100">
<img src="images/i_b_141b.jpg" width="100" height="532" alt="Buchner's

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Buchner's

<small>For Cultivation

or pyrogallic acid, which will
absorb the oxygen which is
present, and thus enable the
anaërobic requirement to be
fulfilled. To various media&mdash;gelatine,
agar, or broth (the
latter used for obtaining the
toxins of anaërobes)&mdash;2 per
cent. of glucose may be added.
Pyrogallic acid, or pyrogallic
acid one part and 20 per cent.
caustic potash one part, is also
readily used for absorptive purposes.
A large glass tube of
25 cc. height, named a Buchner's
cylinder, having a constriction
near the bottom, is taken; and about
two drachms of the pyrogallic solution are placed
in the bottom of it. A test-tube containing the
culture is now lodged in the upper part above the
constriction. The apparatus is now placed in
the incubator at the desired temperature, and the
contained culture grows under anaërobic conditions.
As the pyrogallic solution absorbs the
oxygen it assumes a darker tint.</p>

<p>4. <em>Mechanical Methods.</em> These include various
ingenious tricks for preventing an admittance of oxygen to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
the culture. An old-fashioned one was to plate out the
culture and protect it from the air by covering it with a
plate of mica. A more serviceable mode is to inoculate,
say, a tube of agar with the anaërobic organism, and then
pour over the culture a small quantity of melted agar, which
will readily set, and so protect the culture itself from the
air. Oil may be used instead of melted agar. Another
mechanical method is to make a deep inoculation and then
melt the top of the medium over a bunsen burner, and thus
close the entrance puncture and seal it from the air.</p>

<p>5. <em>Absorption of Oxygen by an Aërobic Culture.</em> This
method takes advantage of the power of absorption of certain
aërobic bacteria, which are planted over the culture of
the anaërobic species. It is not practically satisfactory,
though occasionally good results have been obtained.</p>

<p>6. <em>Lastly, there is the Air-pump Method.</em> By this means
it is obviously intended to extract air from the culture and
seal of it <em>in vacuo</em>. The culture tubes are connected with
the air-pump, and exhausted as much as possible.</p>

<p>Of these various methods it is on the whole best to choose
either the hydrogen method, the vacuum, or the plan of
absorption by grape-sugar or pyrogallic. In anaërobic plate
cultures grape-sugar agar plus 0.5 per cent. of formate of
soda may be used. The poured inoculated plate should be
placed over pyrogallic solution under a sealed bell-glass and
incubated at 37&deg;&nbsp;C. Pasteur, Roux, Joubert, Chamberland,
Esmarch, Kitasato, and others have introduced special apparatus
to facilitate anaërobic cultivation, but the principles
adopted are those which have been mentioned.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap lowercase">THE QUALITATIVE ESTIMATION OF BACTERIA IN THE SOIL</span></h3>

<p>We may now turn to consider the species of bacteria
found in the interstices of soil. They may be classified in
five main groups. The division is somewhat artificial, but
convenient:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span></p>

<p>1. <em>The Denitrifying Bacteria.</em> A group whose function
has been elucidated in recent years (largely by the investigations
of Professor Warington) are held responsible for the
breaking down of nitrates. With these may be associated
the <em>Decomposition or Putrefactive Bacteria</em>, which break
down complex organic products other than nitrates into
simpler bodies.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Method of Growing Cultivations in a Vacuum
over Pyrogallic Solution</span></p>
</div>

<p>2. <em>The Organisms of Nitrification.</em> To this group belong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
the two chief types of nitrifying bacteria, viz., those which
oxidise ammonia into nitrites, and those which change
nitrites into nitrates.</p>

<p>3. <em>The Nitrogen-fixing Bacteria</em>, found mainly in the
nodules on the rootlets of certain plants.</p>

<p>4. <em>The Common Saprophytic Bacteria</em>, whose function is at
present but imperfectly known. Many are putrefactive
germs.</p>

<p>5. <em>The Pathogenic Bacteria.</em> This division includes the
three types, tetanus, malignant œdema, and quarter evil.
Under this heading we shall also have to consider in some
detail the intimate relation between the soil and such important
bacterial diseases as tubercle and typhoid.</p>

<p>To enable us to appreciate the work which the "economic
bacteria" perform, it will be necessary to consider shortly
the place they occupy in the economy of nature. This may
be perhaps most readily accomplished by studying the
accompanying table (p. 145).</p>

<p>The threefold function of plant life is nutrition, assimilation,
and reproduction: the food of plants, the digestive and
storage power of plants, and the various means they adopt
for multiplying and increasing their species. With the two
latter we have little concern in this place. Respecting the
nutrition of plant life, it is obvious that, like animals, they
must feed and breathe to maintain life. Plant food is of
three kinds, viz., <em>water</em>, <em>chemical substances</em>, and <em>gas</em>. Water
is an actual necessity to the plant not only as a direct food
and food-solvent, but as the vehicle of important inorganic
materials. The hydrogen, too, of the organic compounds
is obtained from the decomposition of the water which permeates
every part of the plant, and is derived by it from the
soil and from the aqueous vapour in the atmosphere. The
chief <em>chemical substances</em> of which vegetable protoplasm
is constituted are six, viz, potassium, magnesium, calcium,
iron, phosphorous, and sulphur. These inorganic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a><br /><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>elements do not enter the plant as such, but combined with
other substances or dissolved in water. <em>Potassium</em> occurs in
salt form combined with various organic acids (tartaric,
oxalic, etc.), <em>calcium</em> and <em>magnesium</em> as salts of lime and
magnesia in combination both with organic and inorganic
acids. <em>Iron</em> contributes largely to the formation of the
green colouring matter of plants, and is also derived from
the soil. <em>Phosphorus</em>, one of the chief constituents of seeds,
generally occurs as phosphate of lime. <em>Sulphur</em>, which is
an important constituent of albumen, is derived from the
sulphates of the soil. In addition to the above, there are
other elements, sometimes described as non-essential constituents
of plants. Amongst these are <em>silica</em> (to give stiffness),
<em>sodium</em>, <em>chlorine</em>, <em>iodine</em>, <em>bromine</em>, etc. All these
elements contribute to the formation or quality of the
protoplasm of plants.</p>

<p>The <em>gases</em> essential to plants are four: Carbon dioxide
(carbonic acid), Hydrogen, Oxygen, and Nitrogen. By the
aid of the green chlorophyll corpuscles, and under the influence
of sunlight, we know that leaves absorb the carbon
dioxide of the atmosphere, and effect certain changes in it.
The hydrogen, as we have seen, is obtained from the water.
Oxygen is absorbed through the root from the interstices
of the soil. Each of these contributes vitally to the existence
of the plant. The fourth gas, <em>nitrogen</em>, which constitutes
more than two thirds of the air we breathe (79 per
cent. of the total volume and 77 per cent. of the total weight
of the atmosphere), is, perhaps, the most important food
required by plants. Yet, although this is so, the plant cannot
absorb or obtain its nitrogen in the same manner in
which it acquires its carbon&mdash;viz., by absorption through
the leaves&mdash;nor can the plant take nitrogen into its own substance
by any means as <em>nitrogen</em>, with the exception of the
flesh-feeding plants (insectivorus). Hence, although this
gas is present in the atmosphere surrounding the plant, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
plant will perish if nitrogen does not exist in some combined
form in the soil. Nitrates and compounds of ammonia are
widely distributed in nature, and it is from these bodies
that the plant obtains, by means of its roots, the necessary
nitrogen.</p>

<p>Until comparatively recently it was held that plant life
could not be maintained in a soil devoid of nitrogen or compounds
thereof. But it has been found that certain classes
of plants (the <em>Leguminos&aelig;</em>, for example), when they are
grown in a soil which is practically free from nitrogen at the
commencement, do take up this gas into their tissues. One
explanation of this fact is that free nitrogen becomes converted
into nitrogen compounds in the soil through the
influence of micro-organisms present there. Another explanation
attributes this fixation of free nitrogen to micro-organisms
existing in the rootlets of the plant. These two
classes of organisms, known as the nitrogen-fixing organisms,
will require our consideration at a later stage. Here we
merely desire to make it clear that the main supply of this
gas, absolutely necessary to the existence of vegetable life
upon the earth, is drawn not from the nitrogen of the atmosphere,
but from that contained in nitrogen compounds
in the soil. The most important of these are the <em>nitrates</em>.
Here then we have the necessary food of plants expressed
in a sentence: <em>water, gases, salts, the most important and
essential gas and some of the salts being combined in nitrates</em>.</p>

<p>Plant life seizes upon its required constituents, and by
means of the energy furnished by the sun's rays builds these
materials up into its own complex forms. Its many and
varied forms fulfil a place in beautifying the world. But
their contribution to the economy of nature is, by means of
their products, to supply food for animal life. The products
of plant life are chiefly sugar, starch, fat, and proteids.
Animal life is not capable of extracting its nutriment from
soil, but it must take the more complex foods which have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
already been built up by vegetable life. Again, the complementary
functions of animal and vegetable life are seen
in the absorption by plants of one of the waste materials of
animals, viz., carbonic acid gas. Plants abstract from this
gas carbon for their own use, and return the oxygen to the
air, which in its turn is of service to animal life.</p>

<p>By animal activity some of these foods supplied by the
vegetable kingdom are at once decomposed into carbonic
acid gas and water, which goes back to nature. Much,
however, is built up still further into higher and higher compounds.
The proteids are converted by digestion into
albumoses and peptones, ultimately entirely into peptones;
these in their turn are reconverted into proteids, and become
assimilated as part of the living organism. In time
they become further changed into carbonic acid, sulphuric
acid, water, and certain not fully oxidised products,<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> which
contain the nitrogen of the original proteid. In the table
these bodies have been represented by one of their chief
members, viz., <em>urea</em>.</p>

<p>It is clear that there is in all animal life a double process
continually going on; there is a building up (anabolism, assimilation),
and there is a breaking down (katabolism, dissimilation).
These processes will not balance each other
throughout the whole period of animal life. We have, as
possibilities, elaboration, balance, degeneration; and the
products of animal life will differ in degree and in substance
according to which period is in the predominance. These
products we may subdivide simply into excretions during
life and final materials of dissolution after death, both of
which may be used more or less immediately by other forms
of animal or vegetable life, or mediately after having passed
to the soil. We may shortly summarise the final products
of animal life as carbonic acid, water, and nitrogenous remnants.
These latter will occur as urea, new albumens, com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>pounds
of ammonia, and nitrogen compounds of great complexity
stored up in the tissues and body of the animal.
The carbonic acid, water, and other simple substances like
them will return to nature and be of immediate use to vegetable
life. But otherwise the cycle cannot be completed,
for the more complex bodies are of no service as such to
plants or animals.</p>

<p>1. In order that this complex material should be of service
in the economy of nature, and its constituents not lost, it is
necessary that it should be broken down again into simpler
conditions. This prodigious task is accomplished by the
agency of two groups of organisms, <em>the decomposition and
denitrifying</em><a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> <em>bacteria</em>. The organisms associated with decomposition
processes are numerous; some denitrify as well
as break down organic compounds. This group will be
referred to under "Saprophytic Bacteria." The reduction
by the denitrifying bacteria may be simply from nitrate to
nitrite, or from nitrate to nitric or nitrous oxide gas, or indeed
to nitrogen itself. In all these processes of reduction
the rule is that a loss of nitrogen is involved. How that
free nitrogen is brought back again and made subservient to
plants and animals we shall understand at a later stage.</p>

<p>Professor Warington has again recently set forth the chief
facts known of this decomposition process.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> That the
action in question only occurs in the presence of living
organisms was first established by Mensel in 1875 in natural
waters, and by Macquenne in 1882 in soils. If all living
organisms are destroyed by sterilisation of the soil, denitrification
cannot take place, nor can vegetable life exist.
"Bacteria reduce nitrates," says Professor Warington, "by
bringing about the combustion of organic matter by the
oxygen of the nitrate, the temperature distinctly rising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>during the operation." The reduction to a nitrite is a common
property of bacteria. But only a few species have the
power of reducing a nitrate to gas. These few species are,
however, widely distributed. In 1886 Gayon and Dupetit
first isolated the bacteria capable of reducing nitrates to the
simplest element, nitrogen. They obtained their species
from sewage, but ten years later denitrifying bacteria were
isolated from manure. That soil contains a number of these
reducing organisms is known by introducing a particle of
surface soil into some broth, to which has been added one
per cent. of nitre. During incubation of such a tube gas is
produced, and the nitrate entirely disappears.</p>

<p>Whenever decomposition occurs in organic substances
there is a reduction of compound bodies, and in such cases
the putrefying substances obtain their decomposing and
denitrifying bacteria from the air. The chief conditions
requisite for bringing about a loss of nitrogen by denitrification
are enumerated by Professor Warington as follows:
(1) the specific micro-organism; (2) the presence of a nitrate
and suitable organic matter; (3) such a condition as to
aëration that the supply of atmospheric oxygen shall not
be in excess relatively to the supply of organic matter; (4)
the usual essential conditions of bacterial growth. "Of
these," he says, "the supply of organic matter is by far the
most important in determining the extent to which denitrification
will take place." The necessarily somewhat unstable
condition facilitates its being split up by means of
bacteria. The bacteria in their turn are ready to seize upon
any products of animal life which will serve as their food.
Thus, by reducing complex bodies to simple ones, these
denitrifying organisms act as the necessary link to connect
again the excretions of the animal body, or after death the
animal body itself, with the soil.</p>

<p>In a book of this nature it has been deemed advisable not
to enter into minute description of all the species of bacteria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
mentioned. Some of the chief are described more or less
fully. We cannot, however, do more than name several of
the chief organisms concerned in reducing and breaking
down compounds. As we shall find in the bacteria of
nitrification, so also here, the <em>entire</em> process is rarely, if ever,
performed by one species. There is indeed a remarkable
division of labour, not only between decomposition bacteria
and denitrification bacteria, but between different species of
the same group. <em>Bacillus fluorescens non-liquefaciens</em>, <em>Mycoderma
ure&aelig;</em>, and some of the staphylococci break down
nitrates (denitrification), and also decompose other compound
bodies. Amongst the group of putrefactive bacteria
found in soil may be named <em>B. coli</em>, <em>B. mycoides</em>, <em>B. mesentericus</em>,
<em>B. liquidus</em>, <em>B. prodigiosus</em>, <em>B. ramosus</em>, <em>B. vermicularis</em>,
<em>B. liquefaciens</em>, and many members in the great family
of <em>Proteus</em>. Some perform their function in soil, others in
water, and others, again, in dead animal bodies. Dr.
Buchanan Young, to whose researches in soil we have referred,
has pointed out that in the upper reaches of burial
soil, where these bacteria are most largely present, there is
as a result no excess of organic carbon and nitrogen. Even
in the lower layers of such soil it is rapidly broken down.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Micrococcus from Soil</span></p>
</div>

<p>It will be observed, from a glance at the table, that the
chief results of decomposition and denitrification are as fol<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>lows:
free nitrogen, carbonic acid, gas and water, ammonia
bodies, and sometimes nitrites. The nitrogen passes into
the atmosphere, and is "lost"; the carbonic acid and water
return to nature and are at once used by vegetation. The
ammonia and nitrites await further changes. These further
changes become necessary on account of the fact, already
discussed, that plants require their nitrogen to be in the
form of nitrates in order to use it. Nitrates obviously contain
a considerable amount of oxygen, but ammonia contains
no oxygen, and nitrites very much less than nitrates. Hence
a process of oxidation is required to change the ammonia
into nitrites and the nitrites into nitrates.</p>

<p>2. This oxidation is performed by the <em>nitrifying micro-organisms</em>,
and the process is known as <em>nitrification</em>. It
should be clearly understood that the process of nitrifaction
may, so to speak, dovetail with the process of denitrification.
No exact dividing line can be drawn between the two, although
they are definite and different processes. In a
carcass, for example, both processes may be going on concomitantly;
so also in manure. There is no hard and fast
line to be drawn in the present state of our knowledge.
Other organisms beside the true nitrification bacteria may
be playing a part, and it is impossible exactly to measure
the action of the latter, where they began and where the
preliminary attack upon the nitrogenous compounds terminated.
In all cases, however, according to Professor Warington,
the formation of ammonia has been found to precede
the formation of nitrous or nitric acid.</p>

<p>It was Pasteur who (in 1862) first suggested that the production
of nitric acid in soil might be due to the agency of
germs, and it is to Schlösing and Müntz that the credit belongs
for first demonstrating (in 1877) that the true nature
of nitrification depended upon the activity of a living microorganism.
Partly by Schlösing and Müntz and partly by
Warington (who was then engaged in similar work at Roth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>amsted),
it was later established (1) that the power of nitrification
could be communicated to substances which did not
hitherto nitrify by simply seeding them with a nitrified substance,
and (2) that the process of nitrification in garden
soil was entirely suspended by the vapour of chloroform or
carbon disulphide. The conditions for nitrification, the
limit of temperature, and the necessity of plant food, have
furnished additional proof that the process is due to a living
organism. These conditions are briefly as follows:</p>

<p>1. Food (of which phosphates are essential constituents).
"The nitrifying organism can apparently feed upon organic
matter, but it can also, apparently with equal ease, develop
and exercise all its functions with purely inorganic food"
(Warington).</p>

<p>Winogradsky prepared vessels and solutions carefully purified
from organic matter, and these solutions he sowed with
the nitrifying organism, and found that they flourished.
Professor Warington has employed the acid carbonates of
sodium and calcium with distinct success as ingredients of an
ammoniacal solution undergoing nitrification.</p>

<p>2. The next condition of nitrification is the presence of
oxygen. Without it the reverse process, denitrification,
occurs, and instead of a building up we get a breaking
down, with an evolution of nitrogen gas. The amount of
oxygen present has an intimate proportion to the amount
of nitrification, and with 16 to 21 per cent. of oxygen present
the nitrates are more than four times as much as when the
smallest quantity of oxygen is supplied. The use of tillage
in promoting nitrification is doubtless in part due to the
aëration of the soil thus obtained.</p>

<p>3. A third condition is the presence of a base with which
nitric acid when formed may combine. Nitrification can
take place only in a feebly alkaline medium, but an excess
of alkalinity will retard the process.</p>

<p>4. The last essential requirement is a favourable temper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>ature.
The nitrifying organism can act at a temperature as
low as 37&deg; or 39&deg;&nbsp;F. (3&ndash;4&deg;&nbsp;C.), but at a higher temperature
it becomes much more active. According to Schlösing and
Müntz, at 54&deg;&nbsp;F. (12&deg;&nbsp;C.) nitrification becomes really active,
and it increases as the temperature rises to 99&deg;&nbsp;F. (37&deg;&nbsp;C.),
after which it falls. A high temperature or a strong light
are prejudicial to the process.</p>

<p>We are now in a position to consider shortly some of the
characters of these nitrification bacteria. They may readily
be divided into two chief groups, not in consideration of
their form or biological characteristics, but on account of the
duties which they perform. Just as we observed that there
were few denitrifying organisms which could break down
ammonia compounds to nitrogen gas, so is it also true that
there are few nitrifying bacteria which can build up from
ammonia to the nitrates. Nature has provided that this
shall be accomplished in two stages, viz., a first stage from
ammonia bodies to nitrites, and a second stage from nitrites
to nitrates. The agent of the former is termed the <em>nitrous</em>
organism, the latter the <em>nitric</em> organism. Both are contributing
to the final production of nitrates which can be
used by plant life.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<p><em>The Nitrous Organism</em> (Nitrosomonas). Prior to Koch's
gelatine method the isolation of this bacterium proved an
exceedingly difficult task. But even the adoption of this
isolating method seemed to give no better results, and for
an excellent reason: the nitrifying organisms will not grow
on gelatine. To Winogradsky and Percy Frankland belongs
the credit of separately isolating the nitrous organism on the
surface of gelatinous silica containing the necessary inorganic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>food. Professor Warington, in his lectures under the Lawes
Agricultural Trust, has described this important germ as
follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The organism as found in suspension in a freshly nitrified
solution consists largely of nearly spherical corpuscles, varying
extremely in size. The largest of these corpuscles barely reaches
a diameter of one-thousandth of a millimetre, and some are so
minute as to be hardly discernible in photographs. The larger
ones are frequently not strictly circular, and are sometimes seen
in the act of dividing.</p>

<p>"Besides the form just described, there is another, not universally
present in solutions, in which the length is considerably
greater than its breadth. The shape varies, being occasionally
a regular oval, but sometimes largest at one end, and sometimes
with the ends truncated. The circular organisms are probably
the youngest.</p>

<p>"This organism grows in broth, diluted milk, and other solutions
without producing turbidity. When acting on ammonia it
produces only nitrites. It is without action on potassium nitrite.
It is, in fact, the nitrous organism which, as we have previously
seen, may be separated from soil by successive cultivations in
ammonium carbonate solution."</p></div>

<p>The elongated forms appear to be a sign of arrested
growth. Normally the organ is about 1.8 µ long, or nearly
three times as long as the nitric organism. It possesses a
gelatinous capsule. "The motile cells, stained by Löffler's
method, are seen to have a flagellum in the form of a spiral."
When grown on silica the nitrous organism appears in
the same two forms&mdash;zooglea and free cells&mdash;as when cultivated
in a fluid. It commences to show growth in about
four days, and is at its maximum on about the tenth day.
Winogradsky found that there were considerable differences
in the morphology of the organism according to the
soil from which it was taken. One of the Java soils he
investigated contained a nitrous organism having a spiral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
flagellum of thirty micromillimetres; but its movement was
slow.</p>

<p>As we have already seen, the most astonishing property
of this organism is its ability to grow and perform its specific
function in solutions absolutely devoid of organic matter.
Some authorities hold that it acquires its necessary carbon
from carbonic acid. The mode of culturing it is as follows:</p>

<p>To sterilised flasks add 100 cc. of a solution made of one
gram of ammonium sulphate, one gram of potassium sulphate,
and 1000 cc. of pure water. To this add one gram
of basic magnesium carbonate which has been previously
sterilised by boiling. Now inoculate the flask with a small
portion of the soil under investigation, and after four or five
days sub-culture on the same medium in fresh flasks, and
let this be repeated half a dozen times. Now, as this inorganic
medium is unfavourable to ordinary bacteria of soil,
it is clear that after several sub-cultures the nitrous organism
will be isolated in pure culture.</p>

<p>Winogradsky employs for culturing upon solid media a
mineral gelatine. A solution of from 3 to 4 per cent. of
silicic acid in distilled water is placed in flasks. By the
addition of the following salts to such a solution gelatinisation
occurs:</p>

<p>The sulphates and chloride are mixed in 50 cc. of distilled
water, and the latter substance in the remaining 50 cc. in
separate flasks. After sterilisation and cooling these are all
mixed and added in small quantities to the silicic acid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>

<p>Upon this medium it is possible to sub-culture a pure
growth from the film at the bottom of the flasks in which
the nitrous organism is first isolated.</p>

<p><em>The Nitric Organism.</em> It was soon learned that the
nitrous organism, even when obtainable in large quantities
and in pure culture, was not able entirely to complete the
nitrifying process. As early as 1881 Professor Warington
had observed that some of his cultures, though capable of
changing nitrites into nitrates, had no power of oxidising
ammonia. These he had obtained from advanced sub-cultures
of the nitrous organism, and somewhat later Winogradsky
isolated and described this companion of the nitrous
organism. It develops freely in solutions to which no
organic matter has been added; indeed, much organic matter
will prevent its growing. He isolated it from soils from
various parts of the world on the following media:</p>

<table summary="media"><tr>

<p>About 20 cc. of this solution is placed in a flat-bottom
flask, and a little freshly washed magnesium carbonate is
added. The flask is closed with cotton wool, and the whole
is sterilised. To each flask 2 cc. of a 2 per cent. solution
of ammonium sulphate is subsequently added. The temperature
for incubation is 30&deg;&nbsp;C. Winogradsky concluded
that the oxidation of nitrites to nitrates was brought about
by a specific organism independently of the nitrous organism.
He successfully isolated it in silica jelly. He believes
the organism, like its companion, derives its nutriment
solely from inorganic matter, but this is not finally established.</p>

<p>The form of the nitric organism (or <em>nitromonas</em>, as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
was once termed) is allied to the nitrous organism. The
cells are elongated, rarely oval, but sometimes pear-shaped.
They are more than half a micromillimetre in length, and
somewhat less in thickness. The cells have a gelatinous
membrane. Like the other nitrifying bacteria, its development
and action are favoured by the presence of the acid
carbonates of calcium and sodium. Of the latter, six grams
per litre or even a smaller quantity gives good results. The
sulphate of calcium can be used, but the organism prefers
the carbonates. The differences between these two bacteria
are small, with the exception of their chemical action. The
nitric organism has no action upon ammonia, and the presence
of any considerable amount of ammonium carbonate
hinders its development and prevents its action on a nitrite.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>We may here summarise the general facts respecting nitrification.
Winogradsky proposes to term the group <em>nitro-bacteria</em>,
and to classify thus:</p>

<p>Nitrification occurs in two stages, each stage performed

converted into nitrite; by the other (<em>nitrobacter</em>) the nitrite
is converted into nitrate.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> Both organisms are widely and

very unfavourable to the growth of the nitric organism,
and a few cultivations leave the nitrous organism alone in possession

<p>A word upon the natural distribution of these nitrifying
bacteria before we leave them. They belong to the soil,
river water, and sewage. They are also said to be frequently
present in well water. From some experiments at
Rothamsted it appears that the organisms occur mostly in
the first twelve inches, and in subsoils of clay down to three
or four feet. In sandy soils nitrification may probably
occur at a greater depth. These facts should be borne in
mind when arranging for the purification of sewage by intermittent
filtration.</p>

<p>We have now given some consideration to the chief
events in the life-cycle of nature depicted in the table.
There is but one further process in which bacteria play a
part, and which requires some mention. It will have been
noticed that at certain stages in the cycle there is more or
less appreciable "loss" of free nitrogen. In the process of
decomposition brought about by the denitrifying bacteria,
a very considerable portion of the nitrogen is dissipated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>into the air in the form of a free gas. This is the last stage
of all proteid decomposition, so that wherever putrefaction
is going on there is a continual "loss" of an element essential
to life. Thus it would appear at first sight that the
sum-total of nitrogen food must be diminishing.</p>

<p>But there are other ways also in which nitrogen is being
set free. In the ordinary processes of vegetation there is a
gradual draining of the soil and a passing of nitrogen into
the sea; the products of decomposition pass from the soil
by this drainage, and are "lost" as far as the soil is concerned.
Many of the methods of sewage disposal are in
reality depriving the land of the return of nitrogen which is
its necessity. Again, nitrogen is freed in explosions of gunpowder,
nitroglycerine, and dynamite, for whatever purpose
they are used. Hence the great putrefactive "loss" of
nitrogen, with its subsidiary losses, contributes to reduce
this essential element of all life, and if there were no method
of bringing it back again to the soil, it would seem that
plant life, and therefore animal life, would speedily terminate.</p>

<p>It is at this juncture, and to perform this vital function,
that the <em>nitrogen-fixing bacteria</em> play their wonderful part:
they bring back the free nitrogen and fix it in the soil. Excepting
a small quantity of combined nitrogen coming down
in rain and in minor aqueous deposits from the atmosphere,
the great source of the nitrogen of vegetation is the store
in the soil and subsoil, whether derived from previous accumulations
or from recent supplies by manure.</p>

<p>Sir William Crookes has recently<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> pointed out the vast
importance of using all the available nitrogen in the service
of wheat production. The distillation of coal in the process
of gas-making yields a certain amount of its nitrogen in the
form of sulphate of ammonia, and this, like other nitrogenous
manures, might be used to give back to the soil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>some of the nitrogen drained from it. But such manuring
cannot keep pace, according to Sir W. Crookes, with the
present loss of fixed nitrogen from the soil. We have already
referred to several ways in which "loss" of nitrogen
occurs. To these may well be added the enormous loss occurring
in the waste of sewage when it is passed into the
sea. As the President of the British Association pointed
out,<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> the more widely this wasteful system is extended,
recklessly returning to the sea what we have taken from the
land, the more surely and quickly will the finite stocks of
nitrogen, locked up in the soils of the world, become exhausted.
Let us remember that the plant creates nothing
in this direction; there is nothing in wheat which is not
absorbed from the soil, and unless the abstracted nitrogen
is returned to the soil, its fertility must be ultimately exhausted.
When we apply to the land sodium nitrate, sulphate
of ammonia, guano, and similar manurial substances,
we are drawing on the earth's capital, and our drafts will
not be perpetually responded to.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> We know that a virgin
soil cropped for several years loses its productive powers,
and without artificial aid becomes unfertile. For example,
through this exhaustion forty bushels of wheat per acre
have dwindled to seven. Rotation of crops is an attempt
to meet the problem, and the four-course rotation of turnips,
barley, clover, and wheat witnesses to the fact that practice
has been ahead of science in this matter.</p>

<p>The store of nitrogen in the atmosphere is practically
unlimited, but it is fixed and rendered assimilable only by
cosmic processes of extreme slowness. We may shortly
glance at these, for it is upon these processes, plus a return
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>to the soil of sewage, that we must depend in the future for
storing nitrogen as nitrates.</p>

<p>1. Some combined nitrogen is absorbed by the soil or
plant from the air, for example, fungi, lichens, and some
alg&aelig;, and the absorption is in the form of ammonia and
nitric acid. This is admittedly a small quantity.</p>

<p>2. Some free nitrogen is fixed within the soil by the
agency of porous and alkaline bodies.</p>

<p>3. Some, again, may be assimilated by the higher chlorophyllous
plants themselves, independently of bacteria
(Frank).</p>

<p>4. Electricity fixes, and may in the future be made to fix
more, nitrogen. If a strong inductive current be passed between
terminals, the nitrogen from the air enters into combination
with the oxygen, producing nitrous and nitric acids.</p>

<p>5. Abundant evidence has now been produced in support
of the fact that there is considerable fixation by means of
bacteria.</p>

<p>Bacterial life in several ways is able to reclaim from the
atmosphere this free nitrogen, which would otherwise be
lost. The first method to which reference may be made is
that involving <em>symbiosis</em>. This term signifies "a living
together" of two different forms of life, generally for a
specific purpose. It may be to mutual advantage, a living
for one another, or it may be, by means of an interchange
of metabolism or products, finally to produce or obtain some
remote chemical result. It is convenient to restrict the term
symbiosis to complementary partnerships such as exist between
algoid and fungoid elements in lichens, or between
unicellular alg&aelig; and Radiolarians,<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> or between bacteria and
higher plants. The partnerships between hermit crabs and
sea-anemones and the like are sometimes defined by the term
<em>commensalism</em> (joint diet). Symbiosis and commensalism
must be distinguished from <em>parasitism</em>, which indicates that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>all the advantage is on the side of the parasite, and nothing
but loss on the side of the host. The distinction between
symbiosis and commensalism cannot be rigid, but between
these conditions which are advantageous to the partners and
parasitism, there is an obvious and radical difference. Association
of organisms together for increase of virulence and
function should be distinguished from symbiosis, and mere
<span class="figright200">
<img src="images/i_b_163.jpg" width="200" height="477" alt="Rootlet of Pea with Nodules" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Rootlet of Pea with Nodules</span></span></span>
existence of two or more species
of bacteria in one medium is
not, of course, symbiosis. Most
frequently such a condition
would result in injury and the
subsequent death of the weaker
partner, an effect precisely opposite
to that defined by this
term.</p>

<p>The example of bacteriological
symbiosis with which we are
concerned here is that partnership
between bacteria and some
of the higher plants (<em>Leguminos&aelig;</em>)
for the purpose of fixing
nitrogen in the plant and in the
surrounding soil.</p>

<p><em>The Nitrogen-fixing Bacteria</em>,
the third group of micro-organisms
connected with the soil,
exist in groups and colonies
situated inside the nodules appearing,
under certain circumstances,
on the rootlets of the
pea, bean, and other <em>Leguminos&aelig;</em>.
It was Hellriegel and
Wilfarth who first pointed out that, although the higher
chlorophyllous plants could not directly obtain or utilise free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
nitrogen, some of them at any rate could acquire nitrogen
brought into combination under the influence of bacteria.
Hellriegel found that the gramineous, polygonaceous, cruciferous,
and other orders depended upon combined nitrogen
supplied within the soil, but that the <em>Leguminos&aelig;</em> did not
depend entirely upon such supplies.</p>

<p>It was observed that in a series of pots of peas to which
no nitrogen was added most of the plants were apparently
limited in their growth by the amount of nitrogen locked
up in the seed. Here and there, however, a plant, under
apparently the same circumstances, grew luxuriantly and
possessed on its rootlets abundant nodules. The experiments
of Sir John Lawes and Sir Henry Gilbert at Rothamsted<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>
demonstrated further that under the influence of
suitable microbe-seeding of the soil in which <em>Leguminos&aelig;</em>
were planted there is nodule formation on the roots, and
coincidentally increased growth and gain of nitrogen beyond
that supplied either in the soil or in the seed as combined
nitrogen. Presumably this is due to the fixation, in some
way, of free nitrogen. Nobbe proved the gain of nitrogen
by non-leguminous plants (Elœagnus, etc.) when these grow
root nodules containing bacteria, but to all appearances,
bacteria differing morphologically from the <em>Bacillus radicicola</em>
of the leguminous plants.</p>

<p>These facts being established, the question naturally
arises, How is the fixation of nitrogen to be explained, and
by what species of bacteria is it performed? In the first
place, these matters are simplified by the fact that there is
very little fixation indeed by bacteria in the soil apart from
symbiosis with higher plants. Hence we have to deal
mainly with the work of bacteria in the higher plant. Sir
Henry Gilbert concludes<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> that the alternative explanations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>of the fixation of free nitrogen in the growth of <em>Leguminos&aelig;</em>
seem to be:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"1. That under the conditions of symbiosis the plant is enabled
to fix the free nitrogen of the atmosphere by its leaves;</p>

<p>"2. That the nodule organisms become distributed within the
soil and there fix free nitrogen, the resulting nitrogenous compounds
becoming available as a source of nitrogen to the roots
of the higher plant;</p>

<p>"3. That free nitrogen is fixed in the course of the development
of the organisms within the nodules, and that the resulting
nitrogenous compounds are absorbed and utilized by the host."
"Certainly," he adds, "the balance of evidence at present at
command is much in favour of the third mode of explanation."</p></div>

<p>If this is finally proved to be the case, it will furnish another
excellent example of the power existing in bacteria of assimilating
an elementary substance.</p>

<p>Most authorities would agree that all absorption of free
nitrogen, if by means of bacteria, must be through the roots.
As a matter of fact, legumes, especially when young, use
nitrogen, like all other plants, derived from the soil. It
has been pointed out that, unless the soil is somewhat poor
in nitrogen, there appears to be but little assimilation of
free nitrogen and but a poor development of root nodules.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a>
The free nitrogen made use of by the micro-organism is in
the air contained in the interstices of the soil. For in all
soils, but especially in well-drained and light soils, there is
a large quantity of air. Although it is not known how the
micro-organisms in legumes utilise free nitrogen and convert
it into organic compounds in the tissues of the rootlet or
plant, it is known that such nitrogen compounds migrate
into the stem and leaves, and so make the roots really poorer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>in nitrogen than the foliage. But the ratio is a fluctuating
one, depending chiefly on the stage of growth or maturity
of the plant.</p>

<p>If the nodules from the rootlets of <em>Leguminos&aelig;</em> be examined,
the nitrogen-fixing bacteria can be readily seen.
The writer has isolated these and grown them in pure culture
as follows: The nodules are removed, if possible at an
early stage in their growth, and placed for a few minutes in
a steam steriliser. This is advisable in order to remove the
various extraneous organisms attached to the outer covering
of the nodule. They may then be washed in antiseptic
solution, and their capsules softened by soaking. When
opened with a sterile knife, thick creamy matter exudes.
On microscopic examination this is found to be densely
crowded with small round-ended bacilli or oval bodies,
known as <em>bacteroids</em>. By a simple process of hardening and
using the microtome, excellent sections of the nodules can
be obtained which show these bacteria <em>in situ</em>. In the central
parts of the section may be seen densely crowded colonies
of the bacteria, which in some cases invade the cellular
capsule of the nodule derived from the rootlet. Aërobic and
anaërobic pure cultures of these bacteria were made. In
some cases these cultures very closely resembled the feathery
growth of the bacillus of anthrax.</p>

<p>4. <em>The Saprophytic Bacteria in Soil.</em> This group of
micro-organisms is by far the most abundant as regards
number. They live on the dead organic matter of the soil,
and their function appears to be to break it down into
simpler constitution. Specialisation is probably progressing
among them, for their name is legion, and the struggle for
existence keen. After we have eliminated the economic
bacteria, most of which are obviously saprophytes, the
group is greatly reduced. It is also needless to add that of
the remnant little beyond morphology is known, for as their
function is learned they are classified otherwise. It is prob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>able,
as suggested, that many of the species of common
saprophytes normally existent in the soil act as <em>auxiliary
agents</em> to denitrification and putrefaction. At present we
fear they are disregarded in equal measure, and for the same
reasons, as the common water bacteria. An excess of either,
in soil or water, is not of itself injurious as far as we know;
indeed, it is probably just the reverse. It is, however, frequently
an index of value as to the amount and sometimes
condition of the contained organic matter. The remarks
made when considering water bacteria apply here also, viz.,
that an excess of saprophytes acts not only as index of increase
of organic matter, but as at first auxiliary, and then
detrimental, to pathogenic organisms. It will require accurate
knowledge of soil bacteria generally to be able to say
which saprophytic germs, if any, have no definite function
beyond their own existence. It may be doubted whether
the stern behests of nature permit of such organisms. However
that may be, we may feel confident, though at present
there are many common bacteria in soil, as also in water,
the life object of which is not ascertained, that as knowledge
increases and becomes more accurate this special provisional
group will become gradually absorbed into other groups
having a part in the economy of nature, or in the production
of disease. At present the decomposition, denitrifying,
nitrifying,<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> and nitrogen-fixing organisms are the only saprophytes
which have been rescued from the oblivion of ages,
and brought more or less into daylight. It is but our lack
of knowledge which requires the present division of saprophytes
whose business and place in the world is unknown.</p>

<p>5. <em>The Pathogenic Organisms found in Soil.</em> In addition
to these saprophytes and the economic bacteria, there are,
as is now well known, some disease-producing bacteria find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>ing
their nidus in ordinary soil. The three chief members
of this group are the bacillus of Tetanus (lockjaw), the
bacillus of Quarter Evil, and the bacillus of Malignant
&OElig;dema.</p>

<p><em>Tetanus.</em> The pathology of this terrible disease has
during recent years been considerably elucidated. It was
the custom to look upon it as "spontaneous," and arising
no one knew how; now, however, after the experiments of
Sternberg and Nicolaier, the disease is known to be due to
a micro-organism common in the soil of certain localities,
existing there either as a bacillus or in a resting stage of
spores. Fortunately Tetanus is comparatively rare, and
one of the peculiar biological characteristics of the bacillus is
that it grows only in the absence of oxygen. This fact contributed
not a little to the difficulties which were met with
in securing its isolation.</p>

<p>Tetanus occurs in man and horses most commonly, though
it may affect other animals. There is usually a wound,
often an insignificant one, which may occur in any part of
the body. The popular idea that a severe cut between the
thumb and the index finger leads to tetanus is without
scientific foundation. As a matter of fact, the wound is
nearly always on one or other of the limbs, and is infected
simply because they come more into contact with soil and
dust than does the trunk. It is not the locality of the
wound nor its size that affects the disease. A cut with a
dirty knife, a gash in the foot from the prong of a gardener's
fork, the bite of an insect, or even the prick of a thorn have
before now set up tetanus. Wounds which are jagged, and
occurring in absorptive tissues, are those most fitted to allow
the entrance of the bacillus. The wound forms a local manufactory,
so to speak, of the bacillus and its secreted poisons;
the bacillus always remains in the wound, but the toxins may
pass throughout the body, and are especially absorbed by
the cells of the central nervous system, and thus give rise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
to the spasms which characterise the disease. Suppuration
generally occurs in the wound, and in the pus thus produced
may be found a great variety of bacteria, as well as the
specific agent itself. After a few days or, it may be, as
much as a fortnight, when the primary wound may be
almost forgotten, general symptoms occur. Their appearance
is often the first sign of the disease. Stiffness of the
neck and facial muscles, including the muscles of the jaw,
is the most prominent sign. This is rapidly followed by
spasms and local convulsions, which, when affecting the respiratory
or alimentary tract, may cause a fatal result.
Fever and increased rate of pulse and respiration are further
signs of the disease becoming general. After death, which
results in the majority of cases, there is very little to show
the cause of fatality. The wound is observable, and patches
of congestion may be found on different parts of the nervous
system, particularly the medulla (grey matter), pons, and
even cerebellum. Evidence has recently been forthcoming
at the Pasteur Institute to support the theory that tetanus
is a nervous disease, more or less allied to rabies, and is best
treated by intra-cerebral injection of antitoxin, which then
has an opportunity of opposing the toxins at their favourite
site. (Roux and Borrel.)</p>

<p>In the wound the bacillus is present in large numbers,
but mixed up with a great variety of suppurative bacteria
and extraneous organisms. It is in the form of a straight
short rod with rounded ends, occurring singly or in pairs of
threads, and slightly motile. It has been pointed out that
by special methods of staining, flagella may be demonstrated.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>
These are both lateral and terminal, thin and
thick, and are shed previously to sporulation. Branching
also has been described. Indeed, it would appear that,
like the bacillus of tubercle, this organism has various pleomorphic
forms. Next to the ordinary bacillus, filamentous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>forms predominate, particularly so in old cultures. Clubbed
forms, not unlike the bacillus of diphtheria, may often be
seen from agar cultures. Without doubt the most peculiar
characteristic of this bacillus is its sporulation. The well-formed
round spores occur readily at incubation temperature.
They occupy a position at one or other pole of the bacillus,
and have a diameter considerably greater than the rod.
Thus the well-known "drumstick" form is produced. In
practice the spores occur freely in the medium and in microscopical
preparation. Like other spores, they are extremely
resistant to heat, desiccation, and antiseptics. They can
resist boiling for several minutes.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Bacillus of Tetanus</span></p>
</div>

<p>As we have seen, this bacillus is a strict anaërobe, growing
only in the absence of oxygen. The favourable temperature
is 37&deg;&nbsp;C., and it will only grow very slowly at or below
room temperature.</p>

<p>An excellent culture is generally obtainable in glucose
gelatine. The growth occurs, of course, only in the depth
of the medium, and appears as fine threads passing horizontally
outwards from the track of the needle. At the top
and bottom of the growth these fibrils are shorter than at
the middle or somewhat below the middle. For extraction
of the soluble products of the bacillus glucose broth may be
used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span></p>

<p>In some countries, and in certain localities, the bacillus of
tetanus is a very common habitant of the soil, and when one
thinks how frequently wounds must be more or less contaminated
with such soil, the question naturally arises, How
is it that the disease is, fortunately, so rare? Probably we
must look to the advance of bacteriological science to answer
this and similar questions at all adequately. Much has recently
been done in Paris and elsewhere to emphasise the
relation which other organisms have to such bacteria as
those of typhoid and tetanus. When considering typhoid,
we saw that in addition to the presence of the specific germ
other conditions were requisite before the disease actually
occurred. So in tetanus, Kitasato and others have pointed
out that the presence of certain other bacteria, or of some
foreign body, is necessary to the production of the disease.
The common organisms of suppuration are particularly accused
of increasing the virulence of the bacillus of tetanus.
How these auxiliary organisms perform this function has
not been fully elucidated. Probably, however, it is by
damaging the tissues and weakening their resistance to such
a degree as to afford a favourable multiplying ground for the
tetanus. It is right to state that some authorities hold that
they act by using up the surrounding oxygen, and so favouring
the growth of tetanus.</p>

<p><em>Quarter Evil</em> (or symptomatic anthrax) is a disease of
animals, produced in a manner analogous to tetanus. It is
characterised by a rapidly increasing swelling of the upper
parts of the thigh, sacrum, etc., which, beginning locally,
may attain to extraordinary size and extent. It assumes a
dark colour, and crackles on being touched. There is high
temperature, and secondary motor and functional disturbances.
The disease ends fatally in two or three days.</p>

<p>Slight injuries to the surface of the skin or mucous membrane
are sufficient for the introduction of the causal bacillus.
This organism is, like tetanus, an anaërobe, existing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
in the superficial layers of the soil. From its habitat it
readily gains entrance to animal tissues. It has spores, but
though they are of greater diameter than the bacillus itself
they are not absolutely terminal. Hence they merely swell
out the capsule of the bacillus, and produce a club-shaped
rod. They form gas while growing in the tissues and in
artificial culture. External physical conditions have little
effect upon this bacillus, and the dried and even buried
flesh retains infection for a very long period of time.</p>

<p>The third disease-producing microbe found naturally in
soil is that which produces the disease known as Malignant
&OElig;dema. Pasteur called this <em>gangrenous septicœmia</em>. Unlike
quarter evil, malignant œdema may occur in man in cases
where wounds have become septic. Animals become inoculated
with this bacillus from the surface of soil, straw-dust,
upper layers of garden-earth, or decomposing animal and
vegetable matter.</p>

<p>The bacillus occurs in the blood and tissues as a long
thread, composed of slender segments of irregular length.
It is motile and anaërobic. The spores are larger than the
diameter of the bacillus, and the organism produces gas; so
much is this the case in artificial culture, that the medium
itself is frequently split up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span></p>

<p>Both malignant œdema and symptomatic anthrax are
similar in some respects to anthrax itself. There are, however,
a number of points for differential diagnosis. The
enlargement of the spleen, the non-motility of the bacillus,
the enormous numbers of bacilli throughout the body, the
square ends, equal inter-bacillary spaces, aërobic growth,
and characteristic staining afford ample evidence of anthrax.</p>

<p><em>The Relation of Soil generally to certain Bacterial Diseases.</em>
Recent investigations have, in effect, considerably added
to our knowledge of pathogenic germs in soil; and whilst
the three species enumerated above are still considered as
types normally present in soil, it must not be forgotten that
other virulent disease producers either live in the soil or are
greatly influenced by its conditions.</p>

<p>Fränkel and Pasteur have both demonstrated the possible
presence of anthrax. Fränkel maintained that it could not
live there long, and at ten feet below the surface no growth
occurred. This may have been due to the low temperature
of such a depth. Pasteur held that earthworms are responsible
for conveying the spores of anthrax from buried carcasses
to the surface, and thus bringing about reinfection.
Cholera, too, has been successfully grown in soil, except
during winter. The presence of common saprophytes in
the soil is prejudicial to the development of the cholera
spirillum, and under ordinary circumstances it succumbs in
the struggle for existence. From experiments recently
conducted for the Local Government Board by Dr. Sidney
Martin, evidence is forthcoming in support of the view that
the bacillus of typhoid can live in certain soils. Samples of
soil polluted with organic matter formed a favourable environment
for living bacilli of typhoid for 456 days, whereas
in sterilised soil, without organic matter, these organisms
lived only twenty-three days. Tubercle also has been kept
alive for several weeks in soil.</p>

<p>In passing, a single remark may be made in relation to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
the long periods during which bacteria can retain vitality in
soil. Farm soils have, as is well known, been contaminated
with anthrax in the late summer or autumn, and have retained
the infectious virus till the following spring, and it
has even then cropped up again in the hay of the next
season. In 1881 Miquel took some samples of soil at a
depth of ten inches, containing six and a half million bacteria
per gram. After drying for two days at 30&deg;&nbsp;C., the
dust was placed in hermetically sealed tubes, which were
put aside in a dark corner of the laboratory for sixteen
years. Upon re-examination it is reported that more than
three million germs per gram were still found, amongst
them the specific bacillus of tetanus. Whether or not there
is any fallacy in these actual figures, there is abundant evidence
in support of the fact that bacteria, non-pathogenic
and pathogenic, can and do retain their vitality, and sometimes
even their virulence, for almost incredibly long
periods of time.</p>

<p>It is now some years since Sir George Buchanan, for the
English Local Government Board, and Dr. Bowditch, for the
United States, formulated the view that there is an intimate
relationship between dampness of soil and the bacterial disease
of Consumption (tuberculosis of the lungs). The matter
was left at that time <em>sub judice</em>, but the conclusion has
been drawn, and surely a legitimate one, that the dampness
of the soil acted injuriously in one of two ways. It either
lowered the vitality of the tissues of the individual, and so
increased his susceptibility to the disease, or in some way
unknown favoured the life and virulence of the bacillus.
That is one fact. Secondly, Pettenkofer traced a definite
relationship between the rise and fall of the ground water
with pollution of the soil and enteric (typhoid) fever.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>third series of investigations concluded in the same direction,
viz., the researches of Dr. Ballard respecting summer
diarrhœa. This, it is generally held, is a bacterial disease,
although no single specific germ has been isolated as its
cause. Ballard demonstrated that the summer rise of diarrhœa
mortality does not commence until the mean temperature
of the soil, recorded by the four-foot thermometer,
has attained 56.4&deg;&nbsp;F., and the decline of such diarrhœa
coincides more or less precisely with the fall in soil temperature.
This temperature (56.4&deg;&nbsp;F.) is, therefore, considered
as the "critical" four-foot earth temperature, that is to
say, the temperature at which certain changes (putrefactive,
bacterial, etc.) take place in the pores of the earth, with the
consequent development of the diarrhœal poison.</p>

<p>After a very elaborate and prolonged investigation on behalf
of the Local Government Board, Dr. Ballard formulates
the causes of diarrhœa in the following conclusions:<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></p>

<p>(<em>a</em>)  cause of diarrhœa resides ordinarily in
the superficial layers of the earth, where it is intimately associated
with the life processes of some micro-organism not
yet detected or isolated.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) That the vital manifestations of such organism are
dependent, among other things, perhaps principally upon
conditions of season and the presence of dead organic matter,
which is its pabulum.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) That on occasion such micro-organism is capable of
getting abroad from its primary habitat, the earth, and
having become air-borne, obtains opportunity for fastening
on non-living organic material, and of using such organic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>matter both as nidus and as pabulum in undergoing various
phases of its life history.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) That from food, as also from contained organic matter
of particular soils, such micro-organism can manufacture,
by the chemical changes wrought therein through certain
of its life processes, a substance which is a virulent chemical
poison.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have a large mass of evidence from the
data collected by Buchanan, Bowditch, Pettenkofer, and
Ballard. But much of this work was done anterior to the
time of the application of bacteriology to soil constitution.
Recently the matter has received increased attention from
various workers abroad, and in England from Dr. Sidney
Martin, Professor Hunter Stewart, Dr. Robertson, and
others. The greater part of this work we cannot here consider.
But some reference must be made to Dr. Robertson's
admirable researches into the growth of the bacillus of
typhoid in soil. By experimental inoculation of soil with
broth cultures, he was able to isolate the bacillus twelve
months after, alive and virulent. He concludes that the
typhoid organism is capable of growing very rapidly in certain
soils, and under certain circumstances can survive from
one summer to another. The rains of spring and autumn
or the frosts and snows of winter do not kill them off so long
as there is sufficient organic pabulum. Sunlight, the bactericidal
power of which is well known, had, as would be
expected, no effect except upon the bacteria directly exposed
to its rays. The <em>bacillus typhosus</em> quickly dies out
in the soil of grass-covered areas. Dr. Robertson holds
that the chief channel of infection between typhoid-infected
soil and man is dust. As in tubercle and anthrax, so in
typhoid, dried dust or excreta containing the bacillus is the
vehicle of disease.</p>

<p>Hitherto we have addressed ourselves to those diseases
the known causal organisms of which reside, normally or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
abnormally, in the soil. But closely allied to these matters
connected with the rôle of pathogenic bacteria in soil is the
question of what has been termed the <em>miasmatic</em> influence
of soil. The term "miasm" has had an extensive and
somewhat diffuse application in medical science. It may
happen in the future that typhoid will be classified strictly
as a miasmatic disease. But at present, in the transition
state of the science, it would hardly be justifiable to classify
typhoid with a typically miasmatic disease like malaria.
Yet it is clear that mention should here be made of a group
of diseases of which malaria is the type, and of which the
tropics generally are the native land. The bacterial etiology
of the group is by no means worked out. The cause of
malaria alone is not yet a closed subject. However the details
of the etiology of this group finally arrange themselves,
there is little doubt of two facts, viz., the diseases are probably
produced by bacteria or allied protozoa, and soil plays
an important part in their production.</p>

<p>From what has been said, it will be seen that though a
considerable amount of knowledge has been obtained respecting
bacteria in the soil, it may be conjectured that
actually there is still a great deal to ascertain before the
micro-biology of soil is in any measure complete or even
intelligent. The mere mention of tetanus and typhoid in the
soil, and their habits, nutriment, and products therein, not
to mention the work of the economic bacteria, is to open up
to the scientific mind a vast realm of possibility. It is
scarcely too much to say that a fuller knowledge of the part
which soil plays in the culture and propagation of bacteria
may suffice to revolutionise the practice of preventive medicine.
Truly, our knowledge at the moment is rather a
heterogeneous collection of isolated facts and theories, some
of which, at all events, require ample confirmation; still,
there is a basis for the future which promises much constructive
work.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br /><br />

<small><em>BACTERIA IN MILK, MILK PRODUCTS, AND
OTHER FOODS</em></small></h2>

<p>Injurious micro-organisms in foods are, fortunately for
the consumers, usually killed by cooking. Vast numbers
are, as far as we know, of no harm whatever. Alarming
reports of the large numbers of bacteria which are contained
in this or that food are generally as irrelevant as they are
incorrect. Bacteria, as we have seen, are ubiquitous. In
food we have abundance of the chief thing necessary to
their life and multiplication&mdash;favourable nutriment. Hence
we should expect to find in uncooked or stale food an ample
supply of saprophytic bacteria. There was much wholesome
truth in the assertions made some two years ago by the late
Professor Kanthack, to the effect that good food as well as
bad frequently contained large numbers of bacteria, and
often of the same species. It is well that we should become
familiarised with this idea, for its accuracy cannot be
doubted, and its usefulness at the present time may not
be without its beneficial effect.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is well we should know the bacterial flora
of good and bad foods for at least two reasons. First, there
is no doubt whatever that a considerable number of cases of
poisoning can be traced every year to food containing harmful
bacteria or their products. To several of the more
notorious cases we shall have occasion to refer in passing.
Secondly, we may approach the study of the bacteriology
of foods with some hope that therein light will be found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
upon some important habits and effects of microbes. There
can be little doubt that food-bacteria afford an example of
association and antagonism of organisms to which reference
has already been made. Any information that can be
gleaned to illumine these abstruse questions would be very
welcome at the present time. But there is a still further,
and possibly an equally important, point to bear in mind,
namely, the economic value of microbes in food. In a short
account like the present it will be impossible to enter into
hypotheses of pathology, but we shall at least be able to
consider some of these interesting experiments which have
been conducted in the sphere of beneficial bacteria.</p>

<p>The injurious effects of organisms contained in foods has
been elucidated by the excellent work of the late Dr. Ballard.
From the careful study of a number of epidemics due
to food poisoning, this patient observer was able, without
the aid of modern bacteriology, to arrive at a simple principle
which must not be forgotten. Food poisoning is due
either to bacteria themselves or to their products, which are
contained in the substance of the food. In cases of the first
kind, bacteria gaining entrance to the human alimentary
canal, set up their specific changes and produce their toxins,
and by so doing in course of time bring about a diseased
condition, with its consequent symptoms. On the other
hand, if the products, sometimes called <em>ptomaines</em>, are ingested
as such, the symptoms set up by their action in the
body tissues appear earlier. From these facts Dr. Ballard
deduced the simple principle that if there is no incubation
period or, at all events, a comparatively short space of time
between eating the poisoned food and the advent of disease,
the agents of the disease are products of bacteria. If, on the
other hand, there is an incubation period, the agents are
probably bacteria.</p>

<p>It is necessary to mention two other facts. Dr. Cautley<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>has recently been engaged in isolating from poisoned foods
the different species of bacteria present. It would appear
that these are limited, as a rule, to two or three kinds. As
regards disease, the organisms of suppuration are the most
common. Liquefying or fermentative bacteria are frequently
present, the <em>Proteus</em> family being well represented.
In addition there are, according to circumstances, a number
of common saprophytes. Now, as we have pointed out,
these organisms may act injuriously by some kind of cooperation,
or they may by themselves be harmless, and
pathological conditions be due to the occasional introduction
of pathogenic species.</p>

<p>The other fact, requiring recognition from anyone who
proposes to study the bacteriology of foods, is that a certain
appreciable amount of the responsibility for food poisoning
rests with the tissues of the individual ingesting the food.
There is ample evidence in support of the fact that not all
the persons partaking of infected food suffer equally, and
occasionally some escape altogether. We know little or
nothing of the causes of such modification in the effect
produced. It may be due to other organisms, or chemical
substances already in the alimentary canal of the individual,
or it may be due to some insusceptibility or resistance of
the tissues. Be that as it may, it is a matter which must
not be neglected in estimating the effects of food contaminated
with bacteria or their products.</p>

<p><em>Milk.</em> There are few liquids in general use which contain
such enormous numbers of germs as milk. To begin with,
milk is in every physical way admirably adapted to be a
favourable medium for bacteria. It is constituted of all the
chief elements of the food upon which bacteria live. It is
frequently at a temperature favourable to their growth. It
is <em>par excellence</em> an absorptive fluid. A dish of ordinary
water and a dish of newly drawn milk laid side by side, and
under similar conditions of temperature, will rapidly demon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>strate
the difference in degree of absorptivity between the
two fluids. Yet, whilst this general fact is true, we must
emphasise at the outset the possibility and practicability of
securing absolutely pure sterile milk. Recently some milking
was carried out under strict antiseptic precautions, with
the above sterile result. The udder was thoroughly cleansed,
the hands of the milker washed with corrosive sublimate and
then pure water, the vessels which were to receive the milk
had been carefully sterilised, and the whole process was
carried out in strict cleanliness. The result was that the
sample of milk remained sweet and good and contained no
germs. It should be stated that the first flow of milk, washing
out the milk-ducts of the udder, was rejected. This
fact of the sterility of cleanly drawn milk is not a new one,
and has been established by many bacteriologists. Milk,
then, is normally a sterile secretion. How does it gain its
enormously rich flora of bacteria?</p>

<p><em>Sources of Pollution of Milk.</em> These are various, and depend
upon many minor circumstances and conditions. For
all practical purposes there are three chief opportunities between
the cow and the consumer when milk may become
contaminated with bacteria:</p>

<p>1. At the time of milking.</p>

<p>2. During transit to the town, or dairy, or consumer.</p>

<p>3. After its arrival.</p>

<p><em>Pollution at the Time of Milking</em> arises from the animal,
the milker, or unclean methods of milking. It is now well
known that in tuberculosis of the cow affecting the udder
the milk itself shows the presence of the bacillus of tubercle.
In a precisely similar manner all bacterial diseases of the
cow which affect the milk-secreting apparatus must inevitably
add their quota of bacteria to the milk. To this matter
we shall have occasion to refer again. There is a further
contamination from the animal when it is kept unclean, for
it happens that the unclean coat of a cow will more materi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>ally
influence the number of micro-organisms in the milk
than the popularly supposed fermenting food which the
animal may eat. It is from this external source rather than
from the diet that organisms occur in the milk. The hairy
coat offers many facilities for harbouring dust and dirt. The
mud and filth of every kind that may be habitually seen on
the hinder quarters of cattle all contribute largely to polluted
milk. Nor is this surprising. Such filth at or near
the temperature of the blood is an almost perfect environment
for many of the putrefactive bacteria.</p>

<p>The milker is also a source of risk. His hands, as well as
the clothes he is wearing, can and do readily convey both
innocent and pathogenic germs to the milk. Clothed in
dust-laden garments, and frequently characterised by dirty
hands, the milker may easily act as an excellent purveyor
of germs. Not a few cases are also on record where it appears
that milkers have conveyed germs of disease from
some case of infectious disease, such as scarlet fever, in
their homes. But under the more efficient registration of
such disease which has recently characterised many dairy
companies, the danger of infection from this source has been
reduced to a minimum. The habit of moistening the hands
with a few drops of milk previous to milking is one to be
strongly deprecated.</p>

<p>Professor Russell recounts a simple experiment which
clearly demonstrates these simple but effective sources of
pollution:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"A cow that had been pastured in a meadow was taken for
the experiment, and the milking done out of doors, to eliminate
as much as possible the influence of germs in the barn air.
Without any special precaution being taken the cow was partially
milked, and during the operation a covered glass dish, containing
a thin layer of sterile gelatine, was exposed for sixty seconds
underneath the belly of the cow in close proximity to the milk-pail.
The udder, flank, and legs of the cow were then thor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>oughly
cleaned with water, and all of the precautions referred to
before were carried out, and the milking then resumed. A
second plate was then exposed in the same place for an equal
length of time, a control also being exposed at the same time at
a distance of ten feet from the animal and six feet from the
ground to ascertain the germ contents of the surrounding air.
From this experiment the following instructive data were gathered.
Where the animal was milked without any special precautions
being taken there were 3250 bacterial germs <em>per minute</em>
deposited on an area equal to the exposed top of a ten-inch milk-pail.
Where the cow received the precautionary treatment as
suggested above, there were only 115 germs per minute deposited
on the same area. In the plate that was exposed to the surrounding
air at some distance from the cow there were 65 bacteria.
This indicates that a large number of organisms from the dry
coat of the animal can be kept out of milk if such simple precautions
as these are carried out."<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p></div>

<p>The influence of the barn air, and the cleanliness or otherwise
of the barn, is obviously great in this matter. As we
have seen, moist surfaces retain any bacteria lodged upon
them; but in a dry barn, where molecular disturbance is the
rule rather than the exception, it is not surprising that the
air is heavily laden with microbic life. Here again many
improvements have been made by sanitary cleanliness in
various well-known dairies. Still there is much more to be
done in this direction to ensure that the drawn milk is not
polluted by a microbe-impregnated atmosphere.</p>

<p>The risks in <em>transit</em> differ according to many circumstances.
Probably the commonest source of contamination is in the
use of unclean utensils and milk-cans. Any unnecessary
delay in transit affords increased opportunity for multiplication;
particularly is this the case in the summer months,
for at such times all the conditions are favourable to an
enormous increase of any extraneous germs which may have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>gained admittance at the time of milking. Thus we have
(1) the milk itself affording an excellent medium and supplying
ideal pabulum for bacteria, (2) a more or less lengthened
railway journey or period of transit giving ample time for
multiplication, (3) the favourable temperature of summer
heat. We shall refer again to the rate of multiplication of
germs in milk.</p>

<p>Lastly, many are the advantages given to bacteria when
milk has reached its commercial destination. In milk-shops
and in the home there are not a few risks to be added on to
the already imposing category. Water is occasionally, if
not frequently, added to milk to increase its volume. Such
water of itself will make its own contribution to the flora of
the milk, unless indeed, which is unlikely, the water has
been recently and thoroughly boiled before addition to
the milk. Again, it is impossible to suppose that in
small homes&mdash;perhaps of only one room&mdash;where the milk
stands for several hours, pollution is avoidable. From a
hundred different sources such milk runs the risk of being
polluted.</p>

<p>Before proceeding, a word must be said respecting the
first milk which flows from the udder in the process of milking,
and which is known as the <em>fore-milk</em>. This portion of
the milk is always rich in bacterial life on account of the
fact that it has remained in the milk-ducts since the last
milking. However thorough the manipulation, there will
always be a residue remaining in the ducts, which will, and
does, afford a suitable nidus and incubator for organisms.
The latter obtain their entrance through the imperfectly
closed teat of the udder, and pass readily into the milk-duct,
sometimes even reaching the udder itself and setting up
inflammation (<em>mastitis</em>). Professor Russell states that he
has found 2800 germs in the fore-milk in a sample of which
the average was only 330 per cc. Schultz found 83,000
micro-organisms per cc. in the fore-milk, and only 9000 in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
the mid-milk. As a matter of fact, most of this large number
belong to the <em>lactic-acid fermentation</em> group, and the
fore-milk rarely contains more than two or three species, and
still more rarely any disease-producing bacteria. Still, they
occur in such enormous numbers that their addition to the
ordinary milk very materially alters its quality. Bolley and
Hall, of North Dakota, report sixteen species of bacteria in
the fore-milk, twelve of which produced an acid reaction.
Dr. Veranus Moore, of the United States Department of
Agriculture,<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> concludes from a large mass of data that
freshly drawn fore-milk contains a variable but generally
enormous number of bacteria, but only several species, the
last milk containing, as compared with the fore-milk, very
few micro-organisms. The bacteria which become localised
in the milk-ducts, and which are necessarily carried into the
milk, are for the greater part rapidly acid-producing organisms,
<em>i. e.</em>, they ferment milk-sugar, forming acids. They
do not produce gas. Still their presence renders it necessary
to "pasteurise" as soon as possible. Dr. Moore holds
that much of the intestinal trouble occurring in infants fed
with ordinarily "pasteurised" milk arises from acids produced
by these bacteria between the drawing of the milk
and the pasteurisation.</p>

<p><em>The Number of Bacteria in Milk.</em> From all that has been
said respecting the sources of pollution and the favourable
nidus which milk affords for bacteria, it is not surprising
that a very large number of germs are almost always present
in milk. The quantitative estimation of milk appears more
alarming than the qualitative. It is true some diseases are
conveyed by bacteria in milk, but on the whole most of the
species are non-pathogenic. Nor need the numbers, though
serious, too greatly alarm us, for, as we shall see at a later
stage, disease is a complicated condition, and due to other
agencies and conditions than merely the bacteria, which may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>be the <em>vera causa</em>. In addition to the fact that the high
numbers have but a limited significance, we must also remember
that there is no uniformity whatever in these numbers.
The conditions which chiefly control them are (1)
temperature, (2) time.</p>

<p><em>The Influence of Temperature.</em> We have already noticed,
when considering the general conditions affecting bacteria,
how potent an agent in their growth is the surrounding
temperature. Generally speaking, temperature at or about
blood-heat favours bacterial growth. Freudenreich has
drawn up the following table which graphically sets forth
the effect of temperature upon bacteria in milk:</p>

</tr></table>

<p>This instructive table claims some observations. It will
be noticed that at 59&deg;&nbsp;F. there is very little multiplication.
That may be accepted as a rule. At 77&deg;&nbsp;F. the multiplication,
though not particularly rapid at the outset, results
finally, at the end of the twenty-four hours, in the maximum
quantity. These were probably common species of
saprophytic bacteria, which increase readily at a comparatively
low temperature. During the subsequent hours, after
the twenty-four, we should expect a decline rather than an
increase in 62,000, owing to the keen competition consequent
upon the limitation of the pabulum. From a consideration
of these figures we conclude that a warm temperature, somewhat
below blood-heat, is most favourable to multiplication
of bacteria in milk; that the common saprophytic organisms
multiply the most rapidly; that, in the course of time,
competition kills off a large number.</p>

<p>Concerning these figures little comment is necessary.
But here again, we may remember that this rapid multiplication
continues only up to a certain point, after which
competition brings about a marked reduction.</p>

<p>The effect of temperature and time has been illustrated
by Dr. Buchanan Young's recent researches, laid before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
Royal Society of Edinburgh. He estimated that in the
Edinburgh milk supply three hours after milking there
were 24,000 micro-organisms per cc. <em>in winter</em>; 44,000 <em>in
spring</em>; 173,000 <em>in late summer and autumn</em>. Again, he
found that five hours after milking there were 41,000 micro-organisms
per cc. in country milk, and more than 350,000
micro-organisms per cc. in town milk. Many London milks
would exceed 500,000 per cc.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></p>

<p>There is no standard or uniformity in the numerical estimation
of bacteria in milk. A host of observers have recorded
widely varying returns due to the widely varying
circumstances under which the milk has been collected,
removed, stored, and examined. Nor is it possible to establish
any standard which may be accepted as a <em>normal</em>
or healthy number of bacteria, as is done in water examination.
Bitter has suggested 50,000 micro-organisms per cc.
as a maximum limit for milk intended for human consumption.</p>

<p>But owing to differences of nomenclature and classification,
in addition to differences in mode of examination at present
existing in various countries, it is impossible to state even
approximately how many bacteria and how many species of
bacteria have been isolated from milk. Until some common
international standard is established mathematical
computations are practically worthless. They are needlessly
alarming and sensational. And it should be remembered
that great reliance cannot be placed upon these numerical
estimations. They vary from day to day, and even hour to
hour. Furthermore, vast numbers of bacteria are economic
in the best sense of the term, and the bacteria of milk are
chiefly those of a fermentative kind, and not disease-producers.</p>

<p><em>Kinds of Bacteria in Milk.</em> It is clear from the foregoing
that the only valuable estimation of bacteria in milk is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>qualitative one. The kinds commonly found may be classified
thus:</p>

<p>1. Non-pathogenic; fermenting and various unclassified
micro-organisms.</p>

<p>2. Pathogenic; tuberculosis, typhoid, cholera, scarlet
fever, diphtheria, and suppurative diseases have all been
spread by the agency of milk.</p>

<p>1. <em>The Fermentation Bacteria</em></p>

<p>At the most we can make a merely provisional classification
of these processes. Many of them are intimately related.
Of others, again, our knowledge is at present very
limited. It may be advisable, before proceeding, to consider
shortly what are the constituents of milk upon which
living ferments of various kinds exert their action. A
tabulation of the chief constituents would be as follows:</p>

<p>It is probably too obvious to need remark that milks vary
in standard, but the above figures may be taken as authentic
averages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span></p>

<p><em>Milk-sugar, or Lactose</em> (<span class="gesperrt">C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>24</sub>O<sub>12</sub></span>). This is an important
and constant constituent of milk. It forms the chief
substance in solution in whey or serum. Milk-sugar approximates
to dextrose in its action on polarised light. By
boiling with sulphuric acid it is converted into dextrose and
galactose.</p>

<p><em>Fat</em> occurs in milk as suspended globules, and by churning
may be made into butter.</p>

<p><em>The Proteids</em> include casein, albumen, lactoprotein, and a
small quantity of globulin. These are the nitrogenous
bodies.</p>

<p><em>Mineral Matter.</em> The ash of milk, obtained by careful
ignition of the solids, contains calcium, magnesium, potassium,
sodium, phosphoric acid, sulphuric acid, chlorine, and
iron, phosphoric acid and lime being present in the largest
amounts.</p>

<p>(1) <em>Lactic Acid Fermentation.</em> If milk is left undisturbed,
it is well known that eventually it becomes sour. The casein
is coagulated, and falls to the bottom of the vessel; the
whey or serum rises to the top. In fact, a coagulation
analogous to the clotting of blood has taken place. In
addition to this, the whole has acquired an acid taste. Now,
this double change is not due to any one of the constituents
we have named above. It is, in short, a fermentation set
up by a living ferment introduced from without. The constituent
most affected by the ferment is the milk-sugar,
which is broken down into lactic acid, carbonic acid gas,
and other products.</p>

<p>For many years it has been known that sour milk contained
bacteria. Pasteur first described the <em>Bacillus acidi
lactici</em>, which Lister isolated and obtained in pure culture.
Hueppe contributed still further to what was known of this
bacillus, and pointed out that there were a large number of
varieties, rather than one species, to be included under the
term <em>B. acidi lactici</em>. We have already seen that these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
bacilli do not as a rule liquefy gelatine, form spores, are
non-motile, and are easily killed by heat.</p>

<p>When a certain quantity of lactic acid has been formed
the fermentation ceases. It will recommence if the liquid
be neutralised with carbonate of lime, or pepsine added.
Since Pasteur's discovery of a causal bacillus for this fermentation,
other investigators have added a number of bacteria
to the lactic acid family. Some of these in pure culture
have been used in dairy industry to add to the butter a pure
sour taste, a more or less aromatic odour, and a higher
degree of preservation.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Butyric Acid Fermentation.</em> This form of fermentation
is also one which we have previously considered.</p>

<p>Both in lactic and butyric fermentation we must recognise
that in the decomposition of milk-sugar there are almost
always a number of minor products occurring. Some of the
chief of these are gases. Hydrogen, carbonic acid, nitrogen,
and methane occur, and cause a characteristic effect which
is frequently deleterious to the flavour of the milk and its
products. Most of the gas-producing ferments are members
of the lactic acid group, and are sometimes classified in a
group by themselves. In cheese-making the gases create
the pin-holes and air-spaces occasionally seen.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Curdling Fermentations without Acid Production.</em> Of
these there are several, caused by different bacteria. What
happens is that the milk coagulates, as we have described,
but no acid is produced, the whey being sweet to the taste
rather than otherwise. Digestion of casein may or may not
take place.</p>

<p>We must now mention several fermentations about which
little is known. They are designated by terms denoting
the outward condition of the milk, without giving any information
respecting the real physiological alteration which
has occurred.</p>

<p>(4) <em>Bitter Fermentation.</em> Some bitter conditions of milk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
are due to irregularity of diet in the cow. Similar changes
occur in conjunction with some of the acid fermentations.
Weigmann and Conn have, however, shown that there is a
specific bitterness in milk due to bacteria which appear to
produce no other change. Hueppe suggests that it may
be due in part to a proteid decomposition resulting in bitter
peptones. There seems to be some evidence for supposing
that the bitter bacteria produce very resistant spores, which
enable them to withstand treatment under which the lactic
acid succumbs.</p>

<p>(5) <em>Slimy Fermentation.</em> This graphic but inelegant word
is used to denote an increased viscosity in milk, and its
tendency when being poured to become ropy and fall in
strings. Such a condition deprives the milk of its use in the
making of certain cheeses, whilst in other cases it favours
the process. In Holland, for example, in the manufacture
of Edam cheese, this "slimy" fermentation is desired.
<em>T&aelig;ttem&oelig;lk</em>, a popular beverage in Norway, is made from
milk that has been infected with the leaves of the common
butter wort, <em>Pinguicula vulgaris</em>, from which Weigmann
separated a bacillus possessing the power of setting up slimy
fermentation. There are, perhaps, as many as a dozen
species of bacteria which have in a greater or less degree the
power of setting up this kind of fermentation. In 1882
Schmidt isolated the <em>Micrococcus viscosus</em>, which occurs in
chains and rosaries, affecting the milk-sugar. It grows at
blood-heat, and is not easily destroyed by cold. Its effect
on various sugars is the same. The <em>M. Freudenreichii</em>, the
specific micro-organism of "ropiness" in milk, is a large,
non-motile, liquefying coccus, which can produce its result
in milk within five hours. On account of its resistance to
drying, it is difficult to eradicate when once it makes its
appearance in a dairy. The organism used in making Edam
cheese is the <em>Streptococcus Hollandicus</em>, and in hot milk it
can produce ropiness in one day. A number of bacilli have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
been detected by several observers and classified as slime
fermentation bacteria. The <em>Bacillus lactis pituitosi</em>, a
slightly curved, non-liquefying rod, which is said to produce
a characteristic odour, in addition to causing ropiness, brings
about some acidity. <em>B. lactis viscosus</em> is slow in starting its
fermentation, but maintains its action for as long as a
month. Many of the above organisms, with others, produce
"slimy" fermentation in alcoholic beverages as well
as in milk.</p>

<p>(6) <em>Soapy Milk.</em> This is still another form of fermentation,
the etiology of which has been elucidated by Weigmann.
The <em>Bacillus saponacei</em> imparts to milk a peculiar
soapy flavour. It was detected in the straw of the bedding
and hay of the fodder, and from such sources may infect
the milk. There is little or no coagulation.</p>

<p>(7) <em>Chromogenic Changes.</em> We have already remarked
that colour is the natural and apparently only product of
many of the innocent bacteria. They put out their strength,
so to speak, in the production of bright colours. The chief
colours produced by germs in milk are as follows:</p>

<p><em>Red Milk.</em> <em>Bacillus prodigiosus</em>, in the presence of oxygen,
causes a redness, particularly on the surface of milk.
It was the work of this bacillus that caused "the bleeding
host," which was one of the superstitions of the Middle
Ages. <em>B. lactis erythrogenes</em> produces a red colour only in
the dark, and in milk that is not strongly acid in reaction.
When grown in the light this organism produces a yellow
colour. There is a red sarcina (<em>Sarcina rosea</em>) which also
has the faculty of producing red pigment. One of the
yeasts is another example.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that redness in milk may actually
be due to the presence of blood from the udder of the cow.
In such a case the blood and milk will be inextricably mixed
together, and not in patches or a pellicle.</p>

<p><em>Blue Milk</em> is due to the growth of <em>Bacillus cyanogenus</em>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
This is an actively motile rod, the presence of which does
not materially affect the milk, but causes the milk products
to be of poor quality.</p>

<p><em>Yellow Milk.</em> <em>Bacillus synxanthus</em> is held responsible for
curdling the milk, and then at a later stage, in redissolving
the curd, produces a yellow pigment.</p>

<p><em>Violet and Green Pigments</em> in milk are also the work of
various bacteria.</p>

<p class="center">2. <em>Various Unclassified Bacteria</em></p>

<p>In milk this is a comparatively small group, for it happens
that those bacteria in milk which cannot be classified as
fermentative or pathogenic are few. The almost ubiquitous
<em>Bacillus coli communis</em> occurs here as elsewhere, and might
be grouped with the gaseous fermentative organisms on account
of its extraordinary power of producing gas and breaking
up the medium (whether agar or cheese) in which it is
growing. What its exact rôle is in milk it would be difficult
to say. It may act, as it frequently does elsewhere, by
<em>association</em> in various fermentations. Some authorities hold
that its presence in excessive numbers may cause epidemic
diarrhœa in infants.</p>

<p>Several years ago a commission was appointed by the
<cite>British Medical Journal</cite> to inquire into the quality of the
milk sold in some of the poorer districts of London. Every
sample was found to contain <em>Bacillus coli</em>, and it was declared
that this particular microbe constituted 90 per cent.
of all the organisms found in the milk.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> We record this
statement, but accept it with some misgiving. The diagnosis
of <em>B. coli</em> four or five years ago was not such a strict
matter as to-day. Still, undoubtedly, this particular organism
is not uncommonly found in milk, and its source
is unclean dairying. In the same investigation <em>Proteus</em></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span></p>
<p><em>vulgaris</em>, <em>B. fluorescens</em>, and many liquefying bacteria were
frequently found. Their presence in milk means contamination
with putrefying matter, surface water, or a foul
atmosphere.</p>

<p>A number of water bacteria find their way into milk in
the practice of adulteration, and foul byres afford ample
opportunity for aërial pollution.</p>

<p>Another unclassified group occasionally present in milk is
represented by moulds, particularly <em>Oidium lactis</em>, the mould
which causes a white fur, possessing a sour odour. It is
allied to the <em>Mycoderma albicans</em> (<em>O. albicans</em>), which also
occurs in milk, and causes the whitish-grey patches on the
mucous membrane of the mouths of infants (<em>thrush</em>). These
and many more are occasionally present in milk.</p>

<p class="center">3. <em>The Disease-Producing Power of Milk</em></p>

<p>The general use of milk as an article of diet, especially by
the younger and least resistant portion of mankind, very
much increases the importance of the question as to how
far it acts as a vehicle of disease. Recently considerable
attention has been drawn to the matter, though it is now a
number of years since milk was proved to be a channel for
the conveyance of infectious diseases. During the last
twenty years particular and conclusive evidence has been
deduced to show that milch cows may themselves afford a
large measure of infection. The recent extensive work in
tuberculosis by the Royal Commission has done much to
obtain new light on the conveyance of that disease by milk
and meat. The enormous strides in the knowledge of
diphtheria and other germ diseases have also placed us in
a better position respecting their conveyance by milk.
Generally speaking, for reasons already given, milk affords
an ideal medium for bacteria, and its adaptibility therefore
for conveying disease is undoubted. We may now suitably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
turn to speak shortly of the outstanding facts of the chief
diseases carried by milk.</p>

<p><em>Tuberculosis.</em> It is well known that this disease is not a
rare one amongst cattle. The problem of infective milk is,
however, simplified at the outset by recognising the now
well-established fact that the milk of tuberculous cows is
only certainly able to produce tuberculosis in the consumers
when the <em>tuberculous disease affects the udder</em>. This is not
necessarily a condition of advanced tuberculosis. The udder
may become affected at a comparatively early stage. But
to make the milk infective the udder must be tubercular,
and milk from such an udder possesses a most extraordinary
degree of virulence. When the udder itself is thus the seat
of disease, not only the derived milk, but the skimmed
milk, butter-milk, and even butter, all contain tuberculous
material actively injurious if consumed. Furthermore,
tubercular disease of the udder spreads in extent and degree
with extreme rapidity. From these facts it will be obvious
that it is of first-rate importance to be able to diagnose udder
disease. This is not always possible in the early stage. The
signs upon which most reliance may be placed are the enlargement
of the lymph-glands lying above the posterior
region of the udder; the serous, yellowish milk which later
on discharges small coagula; the partial or total lack of
milk from one quarter of the udder (following upon excessive
secretion); the hard, diffuse nodular swelling and induration
of a part or the whole wall of the udder; and the
detection in the milk of tubercle bacilli. The whole organ
may increase in weight as well as size, and on <em>post-mortem</em>
examination show an increase of connective tissue, a number
of large nodules of tubercle, and a scattering of small
granular bodies, known as "miliary" tubercles. <em>Tuberculin</em>
may be used as an additional test. The udder is affected
in about two per cent. of tuberculous cows.</p>

<p>There are a variety of causes in addition to the <em>vera causa</em>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
the presence of the bacillus of tubercle, which make the disease
common amongst cattle. Constitution, temperament,
age, work, food, and prolonged lactation are the individual
features which act as predisposing conditions; they may act
by favouring the propagation of the bacillus or by weakening
the resistance of the tissues. To this category must
further be added conditions of environment. Bad stabling,
dark, ill-ventilated stalls, high temperature, prolonged and
close contact with other cows, all tend in the same direction.</p>

<p>Though there can be no doubt as to the virulence of tuberculous
milk, it may be remembered with satisfaction that
only about two per cent. of tuberculous cows have unmistakably
tubercular milk. Even of this tubercular milk,
unless it is very rich in bacilli and is ingested in large quantities,
the risks are practically small or even absent. Practically
the danger from drinking raw milk exists only for
persons who use it as their sole or principal food, that is to
say, young children and certain invalids. With adults in
normal health the danger is greatly minimised, as the healthy
digestive tract is relatively insusceptible. Moreover, dairy
milk is almost invariably <em>mixed</em> milk; that is to say, if
there is a tubercular cow in a herd yielding tubercle bacilli
in her milk, the addition of the milk of the rest of the herd
so effectually <em>dilutes</em> the whole as to render it almost
innocuous.</p>

<p>But if for practical purposes we look upon all milk derived
from tubercular udders as highly infective, we may adopt a
comparatively simple and efficient remedy. To avoid all
danger it is sufficient to bring the milk to a boil for a few
minutes before it is consumed; in fact, the temperature of
85&deg;&nbsp;C. (160&deg;&nbsp;F.) prolonged for five minutes kills all bacilli.
The common idea that boiled milk is indigestible, and
that the boiling causes it to lose much of its nutritive value,
is largely groundless.</p>

<p>Milk may become tubercular through the carelessness or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
dirty habits of the milker. Such a common practice as
moistening the hands with saliva previously to milking may,
in cases of tubercular milkers, effectually contaminate the
milk. Again, it may become polluted by dried tubercular
excreta getting into it. Such conveyances must be of rare
occurrence, yet their possibility should not be forgotten.</p>

<p>An infant suckled by a tuberculous mother would run
similarly serious risks of becoming infected with the disease.</p>

<p>In Liverpool, Dr. E. W. Hope, the Medical Officer of
Health, has organised an admirable system of examination
by skilled bacteriologists to find to what degree the Liverpool
milk supply is contaminated with tubercle. The final
result of this pioneer work, which ought really to be undertaken
by every great corporation responsible to the citizens
for a pure water and pure milk supply, is to the effect that
in Liverpool 5.2 per cent. of the samples of milk taken
from the city shippons contains tubercle bacilli. As regards
the milk sent in from the country, the return is that 13.4
per cent. is contaminated with the bacillus of tubercle.<br /><br /></p>

<p><br /><br />Such results are very significant, and indicate the importance
of all large corporations obtaining the service of systematic
and periodic bacteriological examination of the milk
supply. Nor are the results surprising, for when we remember
the habits of the tubercle bacillus we cannot conceive
a more favourable nurture ground than the typical byre.
"Nothing worse than the insanitary conditions of the life
of the average dairy cow," says Sir George Brown, late of
the Board of Agriculture, "can be imagined." It will be
obvious that the above facts make it incumbent upon re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>sponsible
authorities to see that not a stone is left unturned
to enforce cleanliness in all dairy work, isolation of diseased
cows, and strict treatment of all infected milk.</p>

<p><em>Typhoid Fever.</em> Jaccoud in France and Hart in England
have shown that enteric fever (typhoid) is not infrequently
spread by milk. An epidemic affecting 386 persons in
Stamford, Conn., U.S.A., was traced to milk, 97 per cent.
of the cases coming from one single milk supply. Dr.
McNail recently recorded an outbreak of twenty-two cases
of enteric, due to a polluted milk supply.</p>

<p>Within the last twelve months much attention has been
drawn to a milk source of typhoid infection by the epidemic
of typhoid at Bristol. Dr. D. S. Davies has pointed out
that a brook received the sewage of thirty-seven houses, the
overflow of a cesspool serving twenty-two more, the washings
from fields over which the drainage of several others
was distributed, and the direct sewage from at least one
other, and then flowed directly through a certain farm. The
water of this stream supplied the farm pump, and the water
itself, it is scarcely necessary to add, was highly charged
with putrescent organic matter and micro-organisms. This
water was used for washing the milk-cans from this particular
farm, otherwise the dairy arrangements were efficient.
Part of the milk was distributed to fifty-seven houses in
Clifton; in forty-one of them cases of typhoid occurred.
Another part of the milk was sold over the counter; twenty
households so obtaining it were attacked with typhoid fever,
and a number of further infections and complications arose.
This evidence would appear to support the fact that milk
may act in the same way, though not in such a high degree,
as water in the conveyance of typhoid fever.</p>

<p>It may be pointed out that specific typhoid is not a disease
of animals; consequently no danger need be apprehended
from milk if it is properly cared for <em>after</em> it comes
from the cow. Typhoid milk is almost invariably due to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
the addition of typhoid-infected water, either by way of
adulteration or in the process of washing out the milk-cans.
Cases have, however, been recorded in which there has been
direct transmission to the milk from a person convalescing
from the disease, and also indirect transmission by a milker
serving also in the capacity of nurse to a patient in his own
family.</p>

<p>Though the typhoid bacillus appears not to have the
power of multiplying in milk, it has the faculty of existing
and thriving in milk, even when it has curdled or soured,
for a considerable time, and may thus infect milk products
like butter and cheese. But infection by milk products may
be eliminated as of too rare occurrence to deserve attention.
The bacillus does not coagulate the milk like its ally the
<em>Bacillus coli communis</em>, which is a much more frequent and
less injurious inhabitant of milk.</p>

<p><em>Cholera.</em> The cholera bacillus, as we have already pointed
out, is unable to live in an acid medium. Hence its life in
milk is a limited one, and generally depends on some alkaline
change in the milk. Heim found that cholera bacilli
would live in raw milk from one to four days, depending upon
the temperature. D. D. Cunningham, from the results of a
large number of investigations in India, concludes that the
rapidly developing acid fermentations normally or usually
setting in, connected with the rapid multiplication of other
common bacteria and moulds, tend to arrest the multiplication
of cholera bacilli, and eventually to destroy their vitality.
Boiling milk appears, on the contrary, to increase the
suitability of milk as a nidus for cholera bacilli, partly by its
germicidal effect upon the acid-producing microbes, and
partly because it removes from the milk the enormous numbers
of common bacteria, which in raw milk cause such
keen competition that the cholera bacillus finds existence
impossible.</p>

<p>Professor W. J. Simpson, lately the Medical Officer of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
Health for Calcutta, has placed on record an interesting
series of cholera cases on board the <em>Ardenclutha</em>, in the port
of Calcutta, which arose from drinking milk which had been
polluted with one quarter of its volume of cholera-infected
water. This water came from a tank into which some
cholera dejecta had passed. Of the ten men who drank the
milk four died, five were severely ill, and one, who drank but
very little of the milk, was only slightly ill. There was no
illness whatever amongst those who did not drink the milk.</p>

<p><em>Diphtheria.</em> Recent observations on the infectivity of
diphtheria in milk by Schottelius have established the fact
that milk is a good medium for the bacillus of diphtheria,
but that it rarely acts as a vehicle for transmitting the disease.
Klein has emphasised the possibility of this means
of infection. In the first place, it is obvious that the milk
may become infected from a human source&mdash;from pollution
with diphtheritic discharges or dried "fomites." Secondly,
from a variety of different quarters evidence has been forthcoming
to throw some suspicion upon the cow itself as the
agent. Klein states that "a new eruptive disease on the
teats and udder of the cow," consisting of papules, vesicles,
and induration, may be set up by the subcutaneous inoculation
of a pure culture of the <em>Bacillus diphtheri&aelig;</em>. In these
eruptions a bacillus similar to the <em>B. diphtheri&aelig;</em> was demonstrated.
On <em>a priori</em> grounds this evidence substantiates a
belief that diphtheria, in some form or other, may be a disease
of cows. Other observers have not been able to confirm
these observations, and the whole matter of cow diphtheria
must remain for the present <em>sub judice</em>.</p>

<p>As long ago as 1879 W. H. Power traced an epidemic of
diphtheria in North London to the milk supply. In 1887
the same authority studied another outbreak, and other
observers have produced further evidence in favour of the
conveyance of this disease by milk. Air infection of milk
by the <em>Bacillus diphtheri&aelig;</em> probably occurs only very rarely,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
on account of the fact that the organism is readily killed by
desiccation, and yet such is necessary before it can be airborne.
The most frequent mode of infection of milk with
this disease is from the throats, hands, bodies, or clothing
of dairy workers suffering from a mild or acute form of the
disease.</p>

<p>The specific and proved cases in which milk has acted as
the vehicle of diphtheria are, it is true, comparatively few.
Yet, nevertheless, the possibility of milk infection in this
disease is not one which we can afford to neglect.</p>

<p><em>Scarlet Fever.</em> Here again the evidence is not complete,
chiefly owing to the fact that no specific organism of scarlet
fever has yet been discovered. Many cases have, however,
illustrated the undeniable conveyance of the disease by
milk. Even before 1881 a number of milk epidemics of
scarlet fever had been traced out. In 1882 these were
further added to by Mr. W. H. Power's report concerning
a series of cases in Central London. That report was remarkable
for the introduction of a new feature, viz., the
evidence produced in favour of the infection of milk from
some disease of the cow. The Medical Department of the
Local Government Board from that time took up a position
of suspended judgment concerning the belief hitherto
credited that milk could only be infected by <em>human</em> scarlet
fever. In 1886 there was a remarkable epidemic in Marylebone,
and the theory was suggested by Dr. Klein and
Mr. Power that the cow from which the milk was derived
suffered from scarlet fever.</p>

<p>Into the extensive controversy which raged round "the
Hendon disease," as it was called, affecting the cows supplying
the Marylebone milk, we cannot here enter. It will be
sufficient to say that a long discussion took place as to
whether or not this Hendon disease was or was not scarlet
fever. The difficulty of course largely arose from the fact
before mentioned that we do not at present know the specific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
micro-organism of scarlet fever. The Agricultural Department
supported the view of Professor Crookshank that the
cow disease at Hendon was <em>cowpox</em>, and Professor Axe
further pointed out that there was evidence of the Hendon
milk having been contaminated with human scarlet fever.
Whichever conclusion was adopted, all were agreed upon
one point, viz., that the disease had been conveyed from
Hendon to persons in Marylebone by means of the milk.</p>

<p>Mr. Ernest Hart in 1897 published a very large number
of records of scarlatinal milk infection from all parts of the
country, and though the cause of the disease is obscure,
there is now no doubt that it may be and is conveyed by
means of milk.</p>

<p><em>Other Diseases Conveyed by Milk.</em> In addition to the
above, there are other diseases spread by means of polluted
milk. From time to time exceptional cases have occurred
in which a disease like anthrax has been spread by this
means. But it is not to such rare cases that we refer.
There are two very common diseases in which milk has been
proved to play a not inconsiderable part, viz., <em>thrush</em> and
<em>diarrh&oelig;a</em>.</p>

<p>The mould which gives rise to the curd-like patches in
the throats of children, and which is known as <em>Oidium
albicans</em>, frequently occurs in milk. Soft white specks are
seen on the tongue and mucous membrane of the cheeks
and lips, looking not unlike particles of milk curd. If a
scraping be placed upon a glass slide with a drop of glycerine
and examined by means of the microscope, the spores and
mycelial threads of this mould will be seen. The spores are
oval, and possess a definite capsule. The threads are
branched and jointed at somewhat long intervals. Milk
affords an excellent medium for the growth of this parasite.
Thus undoubtedly we must hold milk partly responsible for
spreading this complaint. <em>Penicillium</em>, <em>Aspergillus</em>, and
<em>Mucor</em> are also frequent moulds in milk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span></p>

<p>Professor MacFadyen<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> has given a full account of the
ways in which milk becomes pathogenic, and his views have
received further support from Professor Sheridan Delépine,
who has examined more than one hundred samples of milk
from Liverpool and Manchester. The result of this investigation
has been that milk must be held to be one of the
most potent causes of the summer diarrh&oelig;a of children.
Indeed, a bacillus has been isolated identical with one which
was apparently the cause of this complaint, which carries off
such a large number of infants every summer. It resembles
closely the <em>Bacillus coli communis</em>, which is an almost constant
inhabitant of the alimentary canal, and is held by
many bacteriologists to play, especially in conjunction with
yeasts and other saprophytic organisms, an active rôle in the
intestine of man.</p>

<p>In a recent official report<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> Dr. Hope, of Liverpool, states
that "the method of feeding plays a most important
part in the causation of diarrh&oelig;a; when artificial feeding
becomes necessary, the most scrupulous attention should be
paid to feeding-bottles." Careless feeding, in conjunction
with a warm, dry summer, invariably results in a high death-rate
from this cause. These two causes interact upon each
other. A warm temperature is a favourable temperature for
the growth of the poisonous micro-organism; a dry season
affords ample opportunity for its conveyance through the
air. Unclean feeding-bottles are obviously an admirable
nidus for these injurious bacteria, for in such a resting-place
the three main conditions necessary for bacterial life are well
fulfilled, viz., heat, moisture, and pabulum. The heat is
supplied by the warm temperature, the moisture and food
by the dregs of milk left in the bottle; and the dry air
assists in transit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span></p>

<p>Before passing on to other matters, reference must be
made to poisonous products other than bacteria which
occur in milk and set up ill-health. Vaughan, of Michigan,
pointed out at the London Congress of Hygiene in 1891
that he had separated a poisonous alkaloid, which he called
<em>tyrotoxicon</em>. This, as its name denotes, was a toxic or
poisonous substance, probably produced by some form of
microbe. It may be taken as a type of the organic chemical
substances frequently occurring in milk.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap lowercase">METHODS OF PRESERVING MILK</span></h3>

<p>From the somewhat extensive category of diseases which
may be milk-borne, it will be suitable now to speak of some
of the means at our disposal for obtaining and preserving
good, pure milk.</p>

<p>We considered at the commencement of this chapter the
most frequent channels of contamination. If these be
avoided or prevented, and if the milk be derived from cows
in good health and well kept, the risk of infection is reduced
to a minimum. But we have seen that much, if not
most, of the pollution of milk arises after the milking process
and during transit and storage preparatory to use.
Bacteria are so ubiquitous that to prevent the entrance of
any at all is almost beyond hope. Can anything be done to
prevent their multiplication or to kill them in the milk?
Fortunately the answer is in the affirmative.</p>

<p>There are two means at hand to secure these results.
First, we may add to the milk various chemical or physical
preservatives. Borax or boric acid, formaldehyde, salicylic
acid, and other chemical bodies are used for this purpose.
The commonest of these is that named first. The Food
and Drugs Act (Section VI., 1875) permits the addition of
an ingredient not injurious to health if the same is required
for protection or preparation of the article in question. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
is, however, a difficult matter to determine what amount of
boric acid is injurious to health, for this differs widely in
different persons. It has been laid down by one authority
that even so small an amount as one-tenth per cent. might
have inconvenient results, owing to its cumulative effect.
<em>Formaldehyde</em> is without doubt an excellent antiseptic, and
the more its efficacy becomes known so much the more
probably will it be used. The <em>salicylates</em>, which are mild
antiseptics, have long been used as preservatives. These
substances, then, can be added to milk in quantities not
recognisable to the taste (salicylic acid about .75 grain, and
boracic acid .4 grain, to the litre of milk). They will materially
increase the time that milk will remain sweet, they
will prevent a number of micro-organisms living in the milk,
and will inhibit multiplication of others.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> Secondly, it is
possible very perceptibly to remove the infectivity of milk
by filtration and temperature variations.</p>

<p><em>Filtration</em> has been practised for some time by the Copenhagen
Dairy Company and by Bolle, of Berlin. The filters
used consist of large cylindrical vessels divided by horizontal
perforated diaphragms into five superposed compartments,
of which the middle three are filled with fine sand of three
sizes. At the bottom is the coarsest sand, and at the top
the finest. The milk enters the lowest compartment by a
pipe under gravitation pressure, and is forced upwards, and
finally is run off into an iced cooler, and from that into
the distribution cans. By this means the number of bacteria
is reduced to one-third. The difficulty of drying and
sterilising enough sand to admit a large turnover of milk is
a serious one. This, in conjunction with the belief that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>filtration removes some of the essential nutritive elements
of milk, has caused the process to be but little adopted.
Dr. Seibert states that if milk be filtered through half an
inch of compressed absorbent cotton, seven-eighths of the
contained bacteria will be removed, and a second filtration
will further reduce the number to one-twentieth. One
quart of milk may thus be filtered in fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>The common methods now in vogue for the protection of
milk are based upon <em>germicidal temperatures</em>. Low temperatures,
it is true, do not easily destroy life, but they have a
most beneficial effect upon the keeping quality of milk. At
the outset of the process of cooling, strong currents of air are
started in the milk-can, which act mechanically as deodorisers.
But if the temperature be lowered sufficiently, the
contained bacteria become inactive and torpid, and eventually
are unable to multiply or produce their characteristic
fermentations. At about 50&deg;&nbsp;F. (10&deg;&nbsp;C.) the activity ceases,
and at temperatures of 45&deg;&nbsp;F. (7&deg;&nbsp;C.) and 39&deg;&nbsp;F. (4&deg;&nbsp;C.)
organisms are deprived of their injurious powers. If it happens
that the milk is to be conveyed long distances, then
even a lower temperature is desirable. The most important
point with regard to the cooling of milk is that it should
take place quickly. Various kinds of apparatus are effective
in accomplishing this. Perhaps those best known are Lawrence's
cooler and Pfeiffer's cooler, the advantage of the
latter being that during the process the milk is not exposed
to the air. It must not be forgotten that cooling processes
are not sterilising processes. They do not necessarily kill
bacteria; they only inhibit activity, and under favourable
circumstances the torpid bacteria may again acquire their
injurious faculties. Hence during the cooling of milk
greater care must be taken to prevent aërial contamination
than is necessary during the process of sterilising milk. No
cooling whatever should be attempted in the stable; but,
on the other hand, there should be no delay. Climate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
makes little or no difference to the practical desirability of
cooling milk, yet it is obvious that less cooling will be required
in the cold season.</p>

<p>We now come to the protective processes known as <em>sterilisation</em>
and <em>pasteurisation</em>. As we have already seen, sterilisation
indicates a complete and final destruction of bacteria
and their spores. As applied to methods of preserving milk,
sterilisation means the use of heat at, or above, boiling-point,
or boiling under pressure. This may be applied in
one application of one to two hours at 250&deg;&nbsp;F., or it may
be applied at stated intervals at a lower temperature. The
milk is sterilised&mdash;that is to say, contains no living germs&mdash;is
altered in chemical composition, and is also boiled or
"cooked," and hence possesses a flavour which to many
people is unpalatable.</p>

<p>Now, such a radical alteration is not necessary in order to
secure non-infectious milk. The bacteria causing the diseases
conveyable by milk succumb at much lower temperatures
than the boiling-point. Advantage is taken of this
in the process known as "pasteurisation." By this method
the milk is heated to 167&ndash;185&deg;&nbsp;F. (75&ndash;85&deg;&nbsp;C.). Such a
temperature kills harmful microbes, because 75&deg;&nbsp;C. is decidedly
above their average thermal death-point, and yet
the physical changes in the milk are practically <em>nil</em>, because
85&deg;&nbsp;C. does not relatively approach the boiling-point.
There is no fixed standard for pasteurisation, except that
it must be above the thermal death-point of pathogenic
bacteria, and yet below the boiling-point. As a matter of
fact, 158&deg;&nbsp;F. (70&deg;&nbsp;C.) will kill all souring bacteria as well as
disease-producing organisms found in milk. If the milk is
kept at that temperature for ten or fifteen minutes, we say
it has been "pasteurised." If it has been boiled, with or
without pressure, for half an hour, we say it has been
"sterilised." The only practical difference in the result is
that sterilised milks have a better keeping quality than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
pasteurised, for the simple reason that in the latter some
living germs have been unaffected.</p>

<p>Sterilisation may of course be carried out in a variety of
modifications of the two chief ways above named. When
the process is to be completed in one event an <em>autoclave</em> is
used, in order to obtain increased pressure and a higher
temperature. Milk so treated is physically changed in
greater degree than in the slower process. The slow or
<em>intermittent</em> method is, of course, based on Tyndall's discovery
that actively growing bacteria are more easily killed
than their spores. The first sterilisation kills the bacteria,
but leaves their spores. By the time of the second application
the spores have developed into bacteria, which in
turn are killed before they can sporulate.</p>

<p>The methods of pasteurisation are continually being
modified and improved, especially in Germany and America.
Most of the variations in apparatus may be classed under
two headings. There are, first, those in which a sheet of
milk is allowed to flow over a surface heated by steam or
hot water. This may be a flat, corrugated surface or a
revolving cylinder. The milk is then passed into coolers.
Secondly, milk is pasteurised by being placed in reservoirs
surrounded by an external shell containing hot water or
steam. Dr. A. L. Russell<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> has described one apparatus
consisting of a pasteuriser, a water-cooler, and an ice-cooler.
The pasteuriser is heated by hot water in the outside casement.
To equalise rapidly the temperature of the water
and milk a series of agitators must be used. These are
suspended on movable rods, and hang vertically in the milk
and water chambers. By this ingenious arrangement the
heat is diffused rapidly throughout the whole mass, and as
the temperature of the milk reaches the proper point the
steam is shut off, and the heat of the whole body of water
and milk will remain constant for the proper length of time.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span></p>
<p>The somewhat difficult problem of drawing off the pasteurised
milk from the vat without reinfecting it by contact with
the air is solved by placing a valve inside the chamber, and
by means of a pipe leading the pasteurised milk directly and
rapidly into the coolers. These are of two kinds, which may
be used separately or conjointly. In one set of cylinders
there is cold circulating water, in the other finely crushed ice.</p>

<p>Domestic pasteurisation can be accomplished readily by
heating the milk in vessels in a water-bath raised to the
required temperature for half an hour.</p>

<p>Without entering into a long discussion upon the various
methods adopted, we may summarise some of the chief
essential conditions. It need scarcely be said that the
operation must be efficiently conducted, and in such a way
as to maintain absolute control over the time and temperature.
The apparatus should be simple enough to be easily
cleansed, sterilised, and economical in use. Arrangements
must always be made to protect the milk from reinfection
during and after the process. The entire preparation of the
milk for market may be summed up in four items:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Pasteurisation in heat reservoir.</p>

<p>2. Rapid cooling in water-or ice-coolers.</p>

<p>3. All cans, pails, bottles, and other utensils to be thoroughly
sterilised in steam.</p>

<p>4. The prepared milk must be placed in sterilised bottles and
sealed up.</p></div>

<p>The quality of the milk to be pasteurised is an important
point. All milks are not equally suited for this purpose,
and those containing a large quantity of contamination,
especially of spores, are distinctly unsuitable. Such milks,
to be purified, <em>must</em> be sterilised. Dr. Russell has laid
down a standard test for the degree of contamination which
may be corrected by pasteurisation by estimating the degree
of acidity, a low acidity (<em>e. g.</em>, 0.2 per cent.) usually in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>dicating
a smaller number of spore-bearing germs than that
which contains a high percentage of acid.</p>

<p>Lastly, while the heating process is of course the essential
feature of efficient pasteurisation, it must not be forgotten
that rapid and thorough cooling is almost equally important.
As we have seen, pasteurisation differs from complete
sterilisation in that it leaves behind a certain number of
microbes or their spores. Cooling inhibits the germination
and growth of this organismal residue. If after the heating
process the milk is cooled and kept in a refrigerator, it will
probably keep sweet from three to six days, and may do so
for three weeks.</p>

<p>Before leaving this subject we may glance for a moment
at the bacterial results of pasteurisation and sterilisation.
The chief two of these are the enhanced keeping quality
and the removal of disease-producing germs. The former
is due in part to the latter, and also to the removal of the
lactic acid and other fermentative bacteria. As a general
rule these bacteria do not produce spores, and hence they
are easily annihilated by pasteurisation. True, a number
of indifferent bacteria are untouched, and also some of the
peptonising species. The cooling itself contributes to the
increased keeping power of the milk, especially in transit to
the consumer.</p>

<p>Pasteurised milks have the following three economical and
commercial advantages over sterilised milks, namely, they
are more digestible, the flavour is not altered, and the fat
and lact-albumen are unchanged. Professor Hunter Stewart,
of Edinburgh, about two years ago, compiled from a
number of experiments the following instructive and comprehensive
table (page 212).</p>

<p>It will be admitted that this table exhibits much in favour
of pasteurisation; yet the crucial test must ever be the effect
upon pathogenic bacteria. Flügge has conducted a series
of experiments upon the destruction of bacteria in milk, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
he states that a temperature of 158&deg;&nbsp;F. (70&deg;&nbsp;C.) maintained
for thirty minutes will kill the specific organisms of tubercle,
diphtheria, typhoid, and cholera. MacFadyen and Hewlett
have demonstrated,<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> by sudden alternate heating and cooling,
that 70&deg;&nbsp;C. maintained for half a minute is generally
sufficient to kill suppurative organisms and such virulent
types of pathogenic bacteria as <em>Bacillus diphtheri&aelig;</em>, <em>B.
typhosus</em>, and <em>B. tuberculosis</em>.<br /><br /></p>

<p>As regards the later effect of the process, he states that in
fifteen samples of pasteurised milk examined from November
to December nine of them revealed no organisms, or so
few that they might almost be regarded as sterile; in those
samples examined after January the lowest number was 100
germs per cc., while the average was nearly 5,000. With

<h3><span class="smcap lowercase">BACTERIA IN MILK PRODUCTS</span></h3>

<p>Cream is generally richer in bacteria than milk. <em>Set</em> cream
contains more bacteria than <em>separated</em> cream, but germs are
abundant in both. Yet whilst it is true that cream contains
a large number of bacteria, it must be pointed out that the
butter fat in cream is a less suitable food for organisms than
is the case with milk. Hence the fermentative changes set
up in cream are of less degree than in milk, particularly so
if separated from the milk. Butter-milk and whey vary
much in their bacterial content. Butter necessarily follows
the standard of the cream. But as the butter fat is not
well adapted for bacterial food, the number of bacteria in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>butter is usually less than in cream.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> Moreover, they are
soon reduced both in quality and quantity. Butter examined
after it is several months old is often found to be
almost free from germs; yet in the intervening period a
variety of conditions are set up directly or indirectly through
bacterial action.</p>

<p><em>Rancid</em> butter is partly due to organisms. <em>Putrid</em> butter
is caused, according to Jensen, by various putrefactive bacteria,
one form of which is named <em>Bacillus f&oelig;tidus lactis</em>.
This organism is killed at a comparatively low temperature,
and is therefore completely removed by pasteurisation.
<em>Ill-flavoured</em> butter may be due to germs or an unsuitable
diet of the cow and a retention of the bad quality of the
resulting milk. <em>Lardy</em> and <em>oily</em> butters have been investigated
by Storch and Jensen and traced to bacteria. Lastly,
<em>bitter</em> butter occasionally occurs, and is due to fermentative
changes in the milk. Butter may also contain pathogenic
bacteria, like tubercle. The <em>B. coli</em> can live for one month
in butter.</p>

<p>Cheese suffers from very much the same kind of "diseases"
as butter, except that chromogenic conditions occur
more frequently. The latter are, under certain circumstances,
more the result of chemical than bacterial action.
Most of the troubles in cheese originate in the milk.</p>

<p><em>Method of Examination of Butter.</em> Several grams of the
butter should be placed in a large test-tube, which is then
two-thirds filled with sterilised water and placed in a water-bath
at about 45&deg;&nbsp;C. until the butter is completely melted.
A small quantity may then be added to gelatine or agar and
plated out on Petri dishes or in flat-bottomed flasks in the
usual way. After which the tube may be well shaken and
returned to the bath inverted. In the space of twenty or
thirty minutes the butter has separated from the water with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>which it has been emulsified. It is then placed in the cold
to set. The water may be now either centrifugalised or
placed in sedimentation flasks, and the deposit examined
for bacteria.</p>

<p><em>The Uses of Bacteria in Dairy Produce.</em> In considering the
relation of bacteria to milk we found that many of the
species present were injurious rather than otherwise, and
when we come to consider bacteria in dairy products, like
butter and cheese, we find that the dairyman possesses in
them very powerful <em>allies</em>. Within recent years almost a
new industry has arisen owing to the scientific application
of bacteriology to dairy work.</p>

<p>As a preliminary to butter-making the general custom in
most countries is to subject the cream to a process of
"ripening." As we have seen, cream in ordinary dairies
and creameries invariably contains some bacteria, a large
number of which are in no sense injurious. Indeed, it is to
these bacteria that the ripening and flavouring processes
are due. They are perfectly consistent with the production
of the best quality of butter. The aroma of butter, as we
know, controls in a large measure its price in the market.
This aroma is due to the decomposing effect upon the constituents
of the butter of the bacteria contained in the
cream. In the months of May and June the variety and
number of these types of bacteria are decidedly greater than
in the winter months, and this explains in part the better
quality of the butter at these seasons. As a result of these
ripening bacteria the milk becomes changed and soured, and
slightly curdled. Thus it is rendered more fit for butter-making,
and acquires its pleasant taste and aroma. It is
then churned, after which bacterial action is reduced to a
minimum or is absent altogether. Sweet-cream butter lacks
the flavour of ripened or sour-cream butter. The process is
really a fermentation, the ripening bacteria acting on each
and all of the constituents of the milk, resulting in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
production of various bye-products. This fermentation is a
decomposition, and just as we found when discussing fermentation,
so here also the action is beneficial only if it is
stopped at the right moment. If, for example, instead of
being stopped on the second day, it is allowed to continue
for a week, the cream will degenerate and become offensive,
and the pleasant ripening aroma will be changed to the
contrary.</p>

<p>Bacteriologists have demonstrated that butters possessing
different flavours have been ripened by different species of
bacteria. Occasionally one comes across a dairy which
seems to be impregnated with bacteria that improve cream
and flavour well. In other cases the contrary happens, and
a dairy becomes impregnated with a species having deleterious
effects upon its butter. This species may arise from
unclean utensils and dairying, from disease of the cow, or
from a change in the cow's diet. Thus it comes about that
the butter-maker is not always able to depend upon good
ripening for his cream. At other times he gets ripening to
occur, but the flavour is an evil one, and the results correspond.
It may be bitter or tainted, and just as certainly as
these flavours develop in the cream, so is it certain that the
butter will suffer. Fortunately the bacterial content of the
cream is generally either favourable or indifferent in its
action. Thus it comes about that the custom is to allow
the cream simply to ripen, so to speak, of its own accord, in
a vat exposed to the influence of any bacteria which may
happen to be around. This generally proves satisfactory,
but it has the great disadvantage of being indefinite and uncertain.
Occasionally it turns out wholly unsatisfactory,
and results in financial loss.</p>

<p>There are various means at our command for improving
the ripening process. Perfect cleanliness in the entire
manipulation necessary in milking and dairying, combined
with freedom from disease in the milch cows, will carry us a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
long way on the road towards a good cream-ripening. Recently,
however, a new method has been introduced, largely
through the work and influence of Professor Storch in Denmark,
which is based upon our new knowledge respecting
bacterial action in cream-ripening. We refer to the artificial
processes of ripening set up by the addition of <em>pure cultures
of favourable germs</em>.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> If a culture of organisms possessing
the faculty of producing in cream a good flavour be added
to the sweet cream, it is clear that advantage will accrue.
This simple plan of <em>starting</em> any special or desired flavour
by introducing the specific micro-organism of that flavour
may be adopted in two or three different ways. If cream
be inoculated with a large, pure culture of some particular
kind of bacteria, this species will frequently grow so well
and so rapidly that it will check the growth of the other
bacteria which were present in the cream at the commencement
and before the starter was added. That is, perhaps,
the simplest method of adding an artificial culture.
But secondly, it will be apparent to those who have followed
us thus far, that if the cream is previously <em>pasteurised</em> at 70&deg;
C. these competing bacteria will have been mostly or entirely
destroyed, and the pure culture, or starter, will have the
field to itself. There is a third modification, which is sometimes
termed ripening by <em>natural starters</em>. A natural
starter is a certain small quantity of cream taken from a
favourable ripening&mdash;from a clean dairy or a good herd&mdash;and
placed aside to sour for two days until it is heavily impregnated
with the specific organism which was present in
the whole favourable stock of which the natural starter is
but a part. It is then added to the new cream the favourable
ripening of which is desired. Of the species which
produce good flavours in butter the majority are found to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>be members of the acid-producing class; but probably the
flavour is not dependent upon the acid. Moreover, the
aroma of good ripening is also probably independent of
the acid production.</p>

<p>Of all the methods of ripening&mdash;natural ripening, the
addition of natural starters, the addition of pure cultures
with or without pasteurisation&mdash;there can be no doubt that
pure culture after pasteurisation is the most accurate and
dependable. The use of natural starters is a method in
the right direction; yet it is, after all, a <em>mixed</em> culture,
and therefore not uniform in action. In order to obtain
the best results with the addition of pure cultures, Professor
Russell has made the following recommendations:</p>

<p>1. The dry powder of the pure culture must be added to
a small amount of milk that has been first pasteurised, in
order to develop an active growth from the dried material.</p>

<p>2. The cream to be ripened must first be pasteurised, in
order to destroy the developing organisms already in it, and
thus be prepared for the addition of the pure culture.</p>

<p>3. The addition of the developing starter to the pasteurised
cream and the holding of the cream at such a
temperature as will readily induce the best development of
flavour.</p>

<p>4. The propagation of the starter from day to day. A
fresh lot of pasteurised milk should be inoculated daily
with some of the pure culture of the previous day, not the
ripening cream containing the culture. In this way the
purity of the starter is maintained for a considerable length
of time. Those starters are best which grow rapidly at a
comparatively low temperature (60&ndash;75&deg;&nbsp;F.), which produce
a good flavour, and which increase the keeping qualities of
the butter. Now, whilst it is true that the practice of using
pure cultures in this way is becoming more general, very
few species have been isolated which fulfil all the desirable
qualities above mentioned. In America starters are pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>ferred
which yield a "high" flavour, whereas in Danish
butter a mild aroma is commoner. In England as yet
very little has been done, and that on an experimental scale
rather than a commercial one.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> In 1891 it appears that only
4 per cent. of the butter exhibited at the Danish butter
exhibitions was made from pasteurised cream plus a culture
starter; but in 1895, 86 per cent. of the butter was so made.
Moreover, such butter obtained the prizes awarded for first-class
butter with preferable flavour. Different cultures will,
of course, yield different flavoured butter. If we desire, say,
a Danish butter, then some species like "Hansen's Danish
Starter" would be added; if we desire an American butter,
we should use a species like that known as "Conn's Bacillus,
No. 41." But whilst these are two common types,
they are not the only suitable and effective starters. On
certain farms in England there are equally good cultures,
which, placed under favourable temperatures in new cream,
would immediately commence active ripening.</p>

<p>Professor H. W. Conn, who, with Professor Russell, has
done so much in America for the advancement of dairy
bacteriology, reports<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> a year's experience with the bacillus
to which reference has been made, and which is termed No.
41. It was originally obtained from a specimen of milk
from Uruguay, South America, which was exhibited at the
World's Fair in Chicago, and proved the most successful
flavouring and ripening agent among a number of cultures
that were tried. The conclusions arrived at after a considerable
period of testing and experimentation appear to be
on the whole satisfactory. A frequent method of testing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>has been to divide a certain quantity of cream into two
parts, one part inoculated with the culture and the other
part left uninoculated. Both have then been ripened under
similar conditions, and churned in the same way; the differences
have then been noted. It is interesting to know that,
as a result of the year's experience, creameries have been
able to command a price varying from half a cent to two
cents a pound <em>more</em> for the "culture" butters than for the
uninoculated butters. The method advised in using this
pure culture is to pasteurise (by heating at 155&deg;&nbsp;F.) six
quarts of cream, and after cooling to dissolve in this cream
the pellet containing bacillus No. 41. The cream is then
set in a warm place (70&deg;&nbsp;F.), and the bacillus is allowed to
grow for two days, and is then inoculated into twenty-five
gallons of ordinary cream. This is allowed to ripen as
usual, and is then used as an infecting culture, or "starter,"
in the large cream vats in the proportion of one gallon of
infecting culture to twenty-five gallons of cream, and the
whole is ripened at a temperature of about 68&deg;&nbsp;F. for one
day. The cream ripened by this organism needs to be
churned at a little lower temperature (say 52&deg;-54&deg;&nbsp;F.) but to
be ripened at a little higher temperature than ordinary cream
to produce the best results. Cream ripened with No. 41
has its keeping power much increased, and the body or
grain of the butter is not affected. More than two hundred
creameries in America used this culture during 1895, and
Professor Conn reports that this has proved that its use for
the production of flavour in butter is feasible in ordinary
creameries and in the hands of ordinary butter-makers provided
they will use proper methods and proper discretion.</p>

<p><em>Bacteria in Cheese-making.</em> The cases where it has been
possible to trace bacterial disease to the consumption of
butter and cheese have been rare. Notwithstanding this
fact, it must not be supposed that therefore cheese contains
few or no bacteria. On the contrary, for the making of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
cheese bacteria are not only favourable, but actually essential,
for in its manufacture the casein of the milk has to be
separated from the other products by the use of <em>rennet</em>, and
is then collected in large masses and pressed, forming the
fresh cheese. In the course of time this undergoes ripening,
which develops the peculiar flavours characteristic of cheese,
and upon which its whole value depends.</p>

<p>We have said that the casein is separated by the addition
of rennet, which has the power of coagulating the casein.
But this precipitation may also be accomplished by allowing
acid to develop in the milk until the casein is precipitated,
as in some sour-milk or cottage cheeses. The former
method is of course the usual one in practice. It has been
suggested that the bacteria contained in the rennet exert a
considerable influence on the cheese, but this, although
rennet contains bacteria, is hardly established. It is not
here, however, that bacteria really play their rôle. After
this physical separation, when the cheese is pressed and set
aside, is the period for the commencement of the ripening
process.</p>

<p>That bacteria perform the major part of this ripening process,
and are essential to it, is proved by the fact that when
they are either removed or opposed the curing changes immediately
cease. If the milk be first sterilised, or if antiseptics,
like thymol, be added, the results are negative. It
is not yet known whether this peptonising process is due to
the influence of a single organism or not. The probability,
however, is that it is to be ascribed to the action of that
group of bacteria known as the <em>lactic-acid</em> organisms. Nor
is it yet known whether the peptonisation of the casein and
the production of the flavour are the results of one or more
species. Freudenreich believes them to be due to two
different forms.</p>

<p>However that may be, we meet with at least four common
groups of bacteria more or less constantly present in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
cheese-ripening, either in the early or late stages. First,
there are the <em>lactic-acid bacteria</em>, by far the largest group,
and the one common feature of which is the production by
fermentation of lactic acid; secondly, there are the <em>casein-digesting
bacteria</em>, present in relatively small numbers;
thirdly, the <em>gas-producing bacteria</em>, which give to cheese its
honeycombed appearance; lastly, an indifferent or <em>miscellaneous</em>
group of extraneous bacteria, which were in the milk
at the outset of cheese-making, or are intruders from the
air or rennet. All these four groups may bring about a
variety of changes, beneficial and otherwise, in the cheese-making.</p>

<p>In order that the relation of bacteria to cheese may be
more fully understood, we may draw attention to some experiments
conducted by Professor H. L. Russell as to the
numbers of bacteria present during different stages of the
ripening, excluding those already referred to as present in
the rennet. It appears that there is always at first a marked
increase in the number of micro-organisms, which is soon
followed by a more gradual decline. While the casein-digesting
and gas-producing classes suffer a general and
more or less rapid decline, the lactic-acid bacteria develop
to an enormous extent, from which fact it would appear
that cheese offers ideal conditions for the development of
the latter. In some most interesting records Professor Russell
has divided the ripening process into three divisions:</p>

<p>1. <em>Period of Initial Bacterial Decline in Cheese.</em> Where the
green cheeses were examined immediately after removing
from the press, it was usually found that a diminution in
numbers of bacteria had taken place. This period of decline
lasts but a short time, not beyond the second day.
Lower temperature and expulsion of the whey would account
for this general decline in all species of bacteria.</p>

<p>2. <em>Period of Bacterial Increase.</em> Soon after the cheese is removed
from the press a most noteworthy change takes place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
in green cheese. A very rapid increase of bacteria occurs,
confined almost exclusively to the lactic-acid group. This
commences in green cheese about the eighth day, and continues
more or less for twenty days. In Cheddar cheese it
commences about the fifth day, reaches its maximum about
the twentieth day, declines rapidly to the thirtieth day, and
gradually for a hundred following days. During the first
forty days of this period the casein-digesting and gas-producing
organisms are present, and at first increasing, but
relatively to only a very slight degree. With this rapid
increase in organisms the curd begins to lose its elastic
texture, and before the maximum number of bacteria is
reached the curing is far advanced. Freudenreich has
shown that acid inhibits the growth of the casein-digesting
microbes and <em>vice versâ</em>.</p>

<p>3. <em>Period of Final Bacterial Decline.</em> The cause of this
decline can only be conjectured, but it is highly probable
that it is due to a general principle to which reference has
frequently been made, viz., that after a certain time the
further growth of any species of bacteria is prevented by its
own products. We may observe that the gas-producing
bacteria in Cheddar cheese last much longer than the peptonising
organisms, for they are still present up to eighty
days. Professor Russell aptly compares the bacterial vegetation
of cheese with its analogue in a freshly seeded field.
"At first multitudes of weeds appear with the grass. These
are the casein-digesting organisms, while the grass is comparable
to the more native lactic-acid flora. In course of
time, however, grass, which is the natural covering of soil,
'drives out' the weeds, and in cheese a similar condition
occurs." In milk the lactic-acid bacteria and peptonising
organisms grow together; in ripening cheese the former
eliminate the latter.</p>

<p>We have seen that the conclusion generally held respecting
these lactic-acid bacteria is that they are the main agents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
in curing the cheese. Upon this basis a system of pure
starters has been adopted, the characteristics of which
must be as follows: (<em>a</em>) The organism shall be a pure lactic-acid-producing
germ, incapable of producing gaseous products;
(<em>b</em>) it should be free from any undesirable aroma; (<em>c</em>)
it should be especially adapted for vigorous development
in milk. The starter may be propagated in pasteurised
or sterilised milk from a pure culture from the laboratory.
The advantages accruing from the uses of this lactic-acid
culture, as compared with cheese made without a culture,
are that with sweet milk it saves time in the process of
manufacture; that with tainted milk, in which acid develops
imperfectly, it is an aid to the development of a proper
amount of acid for a typical Cheddar cheese; and that the
flavour and quality of such cheese is preferable to cheese
which has not been thus produced. Professor Russell is of
opinion that the lactic-acid organisms are to be credited
with greater ripening powers than the casein-digesting
organisms, but it must not be forgotten that these two great
families of bacteria are still more or less on trial, and it is
not yet possible finally to dispose of either of them. Mr.
F. J. Lloyd holds that though "the greater the number of
lactic-acid bacilli in the milk the greater the chance of a
good curd," still "this organism alone will not produce that
nutty flavour which is so sought after as being the essential
characteristic of an excellent Cheddar cheese."<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></p>

<p>There are several difficulties to be encountered by dairymen
starting a ripening by the addition of a pure culture.
To begin with, there is the initial difficulty of not being able
to pasteurise milk intended for cheese, as rennet will not
coagulate pasteurised milk (Lloyd). Hence it is impossible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>to avoid some contamination of the milk previous to the
addition of the culture. The continual uncontaminated
supply of pure culture is by no means an easy matter. The
maintenance of a low temperature to prevent the rapid multiplication
of extraneous bacteria will, in some localities, be
a serious difficulty. These difficulties have, however, not
proved insurmountable, and by various workers in various
localities and countries culture-ripening is being carried on.</p>

<p><em>Abnormal Ripening.</em> Unfortunately, from one cause or
another, faulty fermentations and changes are not infrequently
set up. Many of these may be prevented, being
due to lack of cleanliness in the process or in the milking;
others are due to the gas-producing bacteria being present
in abnormally large numbers. When this occurs we obtain
what is known as "gassy" cheese, on account of its substance
being split up by innumerable cavities and holes containing
carbonic acid gas, or sometimes ammonia or free
nitrogen. Some twenty-five species of micro-organisms
have been shown by Adamety to cause this abnormal swelling.
In severe cases of this gaseous fermentation the product
is rendered worthless, and even when less marked the
flavour and value are much impaired. Winter cheese
contains more of this species of bacteria than summer.
Acid and salt are both used to inhibit the action of these
gas-producing bacteria and yeasts, and with excellent results.</p>

<p>We may remark that the character of the gas holes in
cheese is not of import in the differentiation of species. If
a few gas bacteria are present, the holes will be large and
less frequent; if many, the holes will be small, but numerous.
(Swiss cheese having this characteristic is known as
Nissler cheese.)</p>

<p>Many of these gas germs belong to the lactic-acid group,
and are susceptible to heat. A temperature of 140&deg;&nbsp;F.
maintained for fifteen minutes is fatal to most of them,
largely because they do not form spores. The sources of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
the extensive list of bacteria found in cheese are of course
varied, more varied indeed than is the case with milk. For
there are, in addition to the organisms contained in the milk
brought to the cheese factory, the following prolific sources,
viz., the vats and additional apparatus; the rennet (which
itself contains a great number); the water that is used in
the manufacture.</p>

<p>In addition to the abnormalities due to gas, there are also
other faulty types. The following chromogenic conditions
occur: <em>red cheese</em>, due to a micrococcus; <em>blue cheese</em>, produced,
according to Vries, by a bacillus; and <em>black cheese</em>,
caused by a copious growth of low fungi. <em>Bitter cheese</em> is
the result of the <em>Micrococcus casei amari</em> of Freudenreich, a
closely allied form of Conn's micrococcus of bitter milk.
Sometimes cheese undergoes a putrefactive decomposition,
and becomes more or less putrid. These latter conditions,
like the gassy cheeses, are due to the intrusion of bacteria
from without, or from udder disease of the cow. Healthy
cows, clean milking, and the introduction of pure cultures
are the methods to be adopted for avoiding "diseases" of
cheese and obtaining a well-flavoured article which will
keep.</p>

<p>Finally, we may quote five conclusions from the prolonged
researches of Mr. Lloyd<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> which cannot but prove helpful to
the Cheddar cheese industry in England:</p>

<p>1. To make Cheddar cheese of excellent quality, the
<em>Bacillus acidi lactici</em> alone is necessary; other germs will
tend to make the work more rather than less difficult.
Hence scrupulous cleanliness should be a primary consideration
of the cheese-maker.</p>

<p>2. No matter what system of manufacture be adopted, two
things are necessary. One is that the whey be separated
from the curd, so that when the curd is ground it shall contain
not less than 40 per cent. of water, and not more than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>43 per cent.; the other point is that the whey left in the
curd shall contain, developed in it before the curd is put in
the press, at least 1 per cent. of lactic acid if the cheese is
required for sale within four months, and not less than 8
per cent. of lactic acid if the cheese is to be kept ripening for
a longer period.</p>

<p>3. The quality of the cheeses will vary with the quality
of the milk from which they have been made, and proportionately
to the amount of fat present in that milk.</p>

<p>4. "Spongy curd" is produced by at least five organisms,
and one of these is responsible for a disagreeable taint found
in curd. They occur in water. Hence the desirability of
securing clean water for all manipulative purposes, and also
for the drinking purposes of the milch cow.</p>

<p>5. The fact that certain bacteria are found in certain
localities and dairies is due more to local conditions than to
climatic causes.</p>

<p>It is needless to remark that these conclusions once more
emphasise the fact that strict and continual cleanliness is the
one desideratum for bacteriologically good dairying. That
being secured in the cow at the milking, in the transit, and
at the dairy, it is a comparatively simple step, by means of
pasteurisation and the use of good pure cultures of flavouring
bacteria, to the successful application of bacteriology to
dairy produce.</p>

<p><em>Methods of Examination of Milk</em>:</p>

<p>1. <em>Preparation of Microscopic Slides.</em> This course might
at once occur to the mind as the first to adopt in searching
for bacteria in milk. Devices have accordingly been proposed
for saponification previous to staining. Some recommend
the addition of a few drops of a solution of sodium
carbonate; others use methylene blue and chloroform.
But, whatever plan of staining is adopted, this method of
examination in its simplest form is in no degree a criterion
of the bacterial content of a large quantity of milk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span></p>

<p>Hence it has come to be recognised that one of two
manipulations must precede such microscopic examination.
These simple processes are known by the terms of <em>sedimentation</em>
and <em>centrifugalisation</em>. Sedimentation means merely
<span class="figleft125">
<img src="images/i_b_228.jpg" width="125" height="416" alt="A Centrifuge used in the examination
of milk" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">A Centrifuge</span><br />
<small>Used in the Examination
of Milk</small></span></span>
placing the milk in conical glasses in a cool
place for twenty-four hours. The introduction
of improved forms of the centrifuge
has brought the second method of
securing a sediment into preference. Five
cubic centimetres of the milk are introduced
into the graduated bottle, which is
then placed in the centrifuge, and whirled
for one or two minutes. Thus a deposit
of particulate matter is ensured. Cover-glass
specimens of the sediment or deposit
are then prepared and stained in the ordinary
way.</p>

<p>In testing for tubercle something more
is generally necessary. To the 50 cc. of
the milk set aside for sedimentation 10 cc.
of liquefied, colourless carbolic acid are
added. The mixture is shaken and poured
into the conical glass. After standing for
twenty-four hours a little of the sediment
is taken by means of a pipette and examined
by ordinary methods, though after
"fixing" the films with heat they are
some times passed through equal parts of
alcohol and ether. The stain is of course
that usually adopted in tubercle, namely, the Ziehl-Neelsen.
Scheurlen suggested a method for demonstrating the tubercle
bacillus in milk by steeping the cover glasses first in
alcohol and then ether, after which they were stained with
Ziehl-Neelsen.</p>

<p>2. <em>Plate Culture.</em> The milk is to be diluted a thousand or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
more times with sterile water, and ordinary plate cultures
made in Petri dishes or flat-bottomed conical flasks. The
colonies should be counted as late as possible; but even
then the isolation of pathogenic germs is uncertain. As
regards further procedure, the ordinary methods of sub-culturing
adopted in water examination must be strictly
followed, and the special tests for <em>Bacillus typhosus</em> and <em>B.
coli</em> applied. As we have already seen, the quantitative
estimation of organisms in milk is not of the same value as
in water.</p>

<p>3. <em>Inoculation.</em> To test the capacity of the milk for causing
disease, before or after centrifugalisation, preferably the
latter, a certain quantity of the sediment may be inoculated
into guinea-pigs. In suspected tubercle 2 cc. may be taken;
in diphtheria a little less will suffice. The inoculation
should be either intraperitoneal or subcutaneous. Many
authorities hold that this test is the only safe one to protect
the public from milk containing germs of disease.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap lowercase">BACTERIA IN OTHER FOODS</span></h3>

<p><em>Shell-fish</em> have recently claimed the attention of bacteriologists,
owing to the outbreak of typhoid and other epidemics
apparently traceable to <em>oysters</em>.</p>

<p>It is four or five years since Professor Conn startled the
medical world by tracing an epidemic of typhoid fever to
the consumption of some uncooked oysters.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> Almost at the
same time Sir William Broadbent published in the <cite>British
Medical Journal</cite> a series of cases occurring in his practice
which illustrated the same channel of infection. Since then
a number of similar items of evidence to the same effect
have cropped up. Hence there is little wonder that a number
of investigators concentrated their attention upon this
matter. Professors Herdman and Boyce, of Liverpool, Dr.
Cartwright Wood, Dr. Klein, and Dr. Timbrell Bulstrode
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>are some of the chief contributors to the elucidation of this
problem.</p>

<p>The mode of infection of oysters by pathogenic bacteria
is briefly as follows: The sewage of certain coast towns is
passed untreated out to sea. At or near the outfall, oyster-beds
are laid down for the purpose of fattening oysters.
Thus they become contaminated with saprophytic and pathogenic
germs contained in the sewage. It will be at once
apparent that several preliminary questions require attention
before any deductions can be drawn as to whether or not
oysters convey virulent disease to consumers. To the solution
of these Dr. Cartwright Wood was one of the first to
address himself.</p>

<p>The precise conditions which render one locality more
favourable than another in respect to oyster culture are not
fully known. But it has been observed that they do not
flourish in water containing less than three per cent. of salt.
Hence they are absent from the Baltic Sea, which, owing to
the fresh water flowing into it in rivers, contains a smaller
percentage of salt than three. Oysters appear in addition,
to favour a locality where they find their chosen food of
small animalcul&aelig; and particles of organic matter. Such a
favourable locality is the mouth of a river, where tides and
currents also assist in bringing food to the oyster. Unfortunately,
however, in a crowded country like England such
localities round her coasts are frequently contaminated by
sewage from outfalls. Thus the oysters and the sewage
come into intimate relation with each other.</p>

<p>Professor Giaxa carried out some experiments in 1889 at
Naples which appeared to show that the bacilli of cholera
and typhoid rapidly disappeared in ordinary sea-water.
Other observers at about the same time, notably Foster and
Freitag, arrived at an opposite conclusion. In 1894 Professor
Percy Frankland, in a report to the Royal Society, declared
"that common salt, whilst enormously stimulating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
the multiplication of many forms of water bacteria, exerts a
directly and highly prejudicial effect on the typhoid bacilli,
causing their rapid disappearance from the water, whether
water bacteria are present or not." It was at this time,
when the matter was admittedly in an unsatisfactory stage,
that Dr. Cartwright Wood made his experiments.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> We
have not space here to enter into this work. But his conclusions
seem to have been amply established, and were to
the effect that typhoid and cholera bacilli could, as a matter
of fact, exist over very lengthened periods in ordinary sea-water.
The next step was to demonstrate the length of
time the bacilli of cholera remained alive in the pallial cavity
and body of the oyster. Dr. Wood found they did so for
eighteen days after infection, though in greatly diminished
numbers. This diminution was due to one or all of three
reasons: (<em>a</em>) the effect of the sea-water already referred to as
finally prejudicial to bacilli of typhoid; (<em>b</em>) the vital action
of the body-cells of the oyster; (<em>c</em>) the washing away of
bacilli by the water circulating through the pallial cavity.</p>

<p>It will have been noticed that up to the present we have
learned that typhoid bacilli can and do live in sea-water,
and also inside oysters up to eighteen days, but in ever-diminishing
quantities. The question now arises: What is
the influence of the oyster upon the contained bacilli?
Under certain conditions of temperature organisms may
multiply with great rapidity inside the shell of the oyster.
Yet, on the other hand, the am&oelig;boid cells of the oyster,
the acid secretion of its digestive glands, or the water circulating
through its pallial cavity, may act inimically on the
germs. Proof can be produced in favour of the third and
last-named mode by which an oyster can cleanse itself of
germs. So far, then, we have met with no facts which
make it impossible for oysters to contain for a lengthened
period the specific bacteria of disease. Let us now turn to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>their opportunity for acquiring such disease germs. It is
afforded them during the process of what is termed "fattening."
By this process the body of the oyster acquires a
plumpness and weight which enhances its commercial value.
This desired condition is obtained by growing the oyster in
"brackish" water, for thus it becomes filled out and mechanically
distended with water. But if this water contains
germs of disease, what better opportunity could such germs
have for multiplication than within the body-cavity of an
oyster? "The contamination of sea-water, therefore, in
the neighbourhood of oyster-beds may undoubtedly lead to
the molluscs becoming infected with pathogenic organisms"
(Wood). Yet we have seen that, apart altogether from the
individual susceptibilities or otherwise of the consumer, there
are in the series of events necessary to infection many occasions
when circumstances would practically free the oysters
from infection.</p>

<p>The sources of pollution of oysters are not the fattening
beds alone. The native beds also may afford opportunity
for contamination. Thirdly, in packing and transit, and
fourthly, in storage in shops and warehouses, there is frequently
abundant facility for putrefactive bacteria to gain
entrance to the shells of oysters.</p>

<p>Dr. Klein's researches<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> into this question have been
wholly confirmatory of the facts elicited by Dr. Cartwright
Wood. Despite the tendency of the bacilli of cholera and
typhoid to die out quickly in crude sewage, the sewage is
sufficiently altered or diluted at the outfall for these organisms
to exist there in a virulent state. We may give Dr.
Klein's conclusions:</p>

<p>1. That the cholera and typhoid bacilli are difficult of
demonstration in sewage known to have received them.</p>

<p>2. Both organisms may persist in sea-water tanks for two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
or three weeks, the typhoid bacillus retaining its characteristics
unimpaired, the cholera bacillus tending to lose them.</p>

<p>3. Oysters from sources free of sewage contained no
bacteria of sewage.</p>

<p>4. Oysters from sources exposed to risk of sewage contamination
did contain colon bacilli and other sewage
bacteria.</p>

<p>5. In one case Eberth's typhoid bacillus was found in the
mingled body and liquor of the oyster.</p>

<p>Nor do typhoid bacilli lose activity or virulence by passing
through an oyster.</p>

<p>These researches once and for all established the fact that
oysters ordinarily grown on oyster-beds contaminated with
bacteria may, and do on occasion, contain the virulent
specific bacillus of typhoid, which can live both in sea-water
and within the shell of the oyster. This being so, it will
probably appear to the reader that the risk of infection of
typhoid by oysters is very serious indeed. Yet in actual
practice many conditions have to be fulfilled. For, in addition
to the fact that the oysters must be consumed, as
is usual, uncooked, the following conditions must also be
present.</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) Each infective oyster must contain infected sewage,
which presupposes that typhoid excreta from patients suffering
from the disease have passed into that particular sewage
untreated and not disinfected.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) The infective oyster must be fed upon infected sewage,
and still contain the virus in its substance.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) It has to be eaten by a susceptible person.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) There must have been no period of natural cleansing
after "fattening."</p>

<p>Even to this formidable list of conditions we must add the
further remark that, owing to the vitality of the body-cells
of the oyster, or to the lessened vitality of the bacilli of
cholera and typhoid, it is generally the case that the tend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>ency
of these organisms is rather to decrease and die out
than live and multiply.</p>

<p>We shall probably maintain a satisfactory balance of truth
if we place alongside these facts the summary of the Local
Government Board Report.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"There can be no doubt," wrote Sir Richard Thorne, "that
oysters which have been brought into sustained relation with the
typhoid bacillus are liable to exhibit that microbe within the shell
contents and to retain it for a while under circumstances not only
permitting its rapid multiplication when transferred again to appropriate
media, but conserving at the same time its ability to
manifest its hurtful properties."</p></div>

<p>From what has been said the preventive treatment is
obvious. All oyster-layings and shell-fish beds round the
coast should be superintended and inspected by the sanitary
authority of the Government. The importation of foreign
oysters, grown on uncontrolled beds, should, if possible, be
<em>restricted</em> or <em>supervised</em>. Further, as a protective measure of
the first importance, oysters should be cleansed, after fattening
on a contaminated bed, by being deposited for several
weeks at some point along the coast which is washed by
pure sea-water. Retention in dirty water-tanks, in uncleanly
shops and warehouses, is also to be greatly deprecated.</p>

<p>In order to examine oysters bacteriologically, it is necessary
to pay particular attention to the water in the pallial
cavity, the contents of the alimentary canal, and the washings
of the shell itself. Ordinary media may be used for
obtaining a growth of the contained organisms.</p>

<p><em>Other shell-fish</em> than oysters do, from time to time, cause
epidemics or individual cases of gastro-intestinal irritation,
and probably contain various germs. These they acquire in
all probability from their food, which by their own choice
is frequently of a doubtful character.</p>

<p><em>Meat.</em> Parasites are occasionally found in meat, but
bacteria are comparatively rare. Not that they do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
occur in the bodies of animals used for human consumption,
for in the glands, mesenteries, and other organs they are
common. But in those portions of the carcass which are
used by man, namely the muscles, bacteria are rare. The
reasons alleged for this are the acid reaction (sarcolactic
acid) and the more or less constant movement during life.
A bacterial disease which, perhaps more than any other,
might be expected to be conveyed by meat is tubercle. Yet
the recent Royal Commission on Tuberculosis has again
emphasised the absence of bacilli in the meat substance:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"In tissues which go to form the butcher's joint, the material
of tubercle is not often found even where the organs (lungs, liver,
spleen, membranes, etc.) exhibit very advanced or generalised
tuberculosis; indeed, in muscle and muscle juice it is very seldom
that tubercle bacilli are to be met with; perhaps they are somewhat
more often to be discovered in bone, or in some small
lymphatic gland embedded in intermuscular fat."<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p></div>

<p>The only way in which such meat substance becomes infected
with tubercle appears to be through carelessness in
the butcher, who perchance smears the meat substance with
a knife that has been used in cutting the organs, and so has
become contaminated with infected material. Very instructive
also are the results at which Dr. Sims Woodhead arrived
in compiling evidence for the same Commission on the effect
of cooking upon tuberculous meat:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Ordinary cooking, such as boiling and more especially roasting,
though quite sufficient to sterilise the surface, and even the
substance for a short distance from the surface of a joint, cannot
be relied upon to sterilise tubercular material included in the
centre of rolls of meat, especially when these are more than three
pounds or four pounds weight. The least reliable method of
cooking for this purpose is roasting before a fire; next comes
roasting in an oven, and then boiling."<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span></p>

<p>From this statement it will be understood that rolled meat
may be a source of infection to a greater degree than the
ordinary joint.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this negative evidence, more than twenty
species of bacteria have been isolated from canned meats
and hams, and a considerable number of poisoning cases
have occurred from meat contaminated with bacteria or their
products. The general symptoms of such meat poisoning
are vomiting, diarrh&oelig;a, fever, and more or less prostration.
Ballard and Klein isolated a specific microbe from samples
of bacon which appear to have caused an epidemic of infectious
pneumonia at Middlesborough. In 1880 occurred
the well-known "Welbeck disease" epidemic. A public
luncheon was followed by severe and even fatal illness.
Seventy-two persons were affected, and four died. A specific
bacillus was isolated by Klein. In 1881 much the
same thing happened at Nottingham, in which fifteen persons
were attacked, and one died. The same bacillus was
isolated from the pernicious pork. Again in 1889 an outbreak
of diarrh&oelig;a at Carlisle was traced to bacterially diseased
pork. But taking these and similar cases at their
worst, there can be no doubt that under no circumstances is
meat as infective as milk.</p>

<p><em>Ice-cream.</em> In 1894 Dr. Klein had occasion to bacteriologically
examine ice-creams sold in the streets of London.
In all six samples were analysed, and in each sample the
conclusions resulting were of a nature sufficiently serious to
support the view that the bacterial flora was not inferior to
ordinary sewage. The water in which the ice-cream glasses
were washed was also examined, and found to contain large
numbers of bacteria.</p>

<p>Since that date many investigations have been made into
ice-creams. It appears that they are often made under extremely
foul circumstances, and with anything but sterilised
appliances. Little wonder, then, that the numbers of bac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>teria
present run into millions. In nearly all recorded cases
the quality of the germs as well as the quantity has been of
a nature to cause some concern. <em>Bacillus coli communis</em>,
which, though not now considered absolutely indicative of
alimentary pollution, is looked upon as a highly unsatisfactory
inhabitant of water, has been found in considerable
abundance. The <em>Proteus</em> family, which also possesses a
putrefactive function, is common in ice-creams. The <em>common
water bacteria</em> are nearly always present.</p>

<p><em>Bacillus typhosus</em> itself, it is said, has been isolated from
some ice-cream which was held responsible for an outbreak
of enteric fever. The material had become infected during
process of manufacture in the house of a person suffering
from unnotified typhoid fever.</p>

<p>Now, whilst reports of the above nature appear very
alarming, the fact is that hundreds of weakly children devour
ice-cream with apparent impunity, and when evil follows
it is not infrequently due to other than bacterial
conditions. The cold mass itself may inhibit the resistance
of the gastric tissues. <em>Tyrotoxicon</em>, the alkaloid separated
from cheese and cream by Vaughan, may be responsible for
some alimentary irritation. On the whole, the practical
effect upon the community is not in proportion to the
bacterial content of the ice-cream. Yet, nevertheless, we
ought to be much more watchful than in the past to preserve
ice-cream from pollution with harmful bacteria.</p>

<p>The two chief constituents which contribute their quota
of germ life to ice-cream are <em>ice</em> and <em>cream</em>. In addition,
the uncleanly methods of manufacture render the material
likely to contain the six or seven millions of micro-organisms
per cc. which have been on several occasions estimated.
To cleanly methods of dairying we have already fully referred;
to the bacterial content of milk and cream we have
also paid some attention; but we have not had an opportunity
of saying anything of germs in ice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span></p>

<p><em>Ice</em> contains bacteria in varying quantities from 20 per cc.
to 10,000 or more. Nor is variation in number affected
alone by the condition of the water, for samples collected
from one and the same place differ widely. The quality
follows in large measure the standard of the water.</p>

<p>Water bacteria, <em>Bacillus coli</em>, putrefactive bacteria, and
even pathogenic have been found in ice. Many of the
latter can live without much difficulty and are most numerous
in ice containing air-bubbles.</p>

<p>Dr. Prudden, of New York, performed a series of experiments
in 1887 to show the relative behaviour of bacteria in
ice. Taking half a dozen species, he inoculated sterilised
water and reduced it to a very low temperature for a hundred
and three days, with the following results:&mdash;<em>Bacillus
prodigiosus</em> diminished from 6,300 per cc. to 3,000 within the
first four days, to 22 in thirty-seven days, and vanished
altogether in fifty-one days; a liquefying water bacillus,
numbering 800,000 per cc. at the commencement, had disappeared
in four days; <em>Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus</em> and
<em>B. fluorescens</em> showed large numbers present at the end of
sixty-six and seventy-seven days respectively; <em>B. typhosus</em>,
which was present 1,000,000 per cc. after eleven days, fell
to 72,000 after 77 days, and 7,000 at the end of 103 days.
Anthrax bacilli are susceptible to freezing, but their spores
are practically unaffected (Frankland).</p>

<p>From these facts it will be seen that bacteria live, but do
not multiply, in ice.</p>

<p>In making a bacterial investigation into the flora of ice-cream,
it is necessary to remember that considerable dilution
with sterilised water is required. The usual methods of
examining water and milk are adopted.</p>

<p><em>Bread</em> forms an excellent medium for moulds, but unless
specially exposed the bacteria in it are few. Waldo and
Walsh have, however, demonstrated that baking does not
sterilise the interior of bread. These observers cultivated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
numerous bacteria from the centre of newly baked London
loaves.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> The writer has recently made a series of examinations
of the air of several underground bakehouses in Central
London; but, though the air was highly impregnated
with flour-dust, few bacteria were present.</p>

<p>Other foods and beverages may be, and are, from time to
time contaminated in some small degree with bacteria or
their spores. Such contaminations are generally due to
uncleanly manufacture or unprotected storage. The principles
of examination or of the prevention of pollution are
similar to those already described.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br /><br />

<small><em>THE QUESTION OF IMMUNITY AND ANTITOXINS</em></small></h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE term <em>natural immunity</em> is used to denote natural
resistance to some particular specific disease. It may
refer to race, or age, or individual idiosyncrasies. We not
infrequently meet with examples of this freedom from disease.
Certain races of men do not, as a rule, take certain
diseases. For example, plague and leprosy, though endemic
in some countries, fail to get a footing in England.
This, of course, is due in great measure to the sanitary
organisation and cleanly customs of the English people.
Still, it is also due to the fact that the English appear in
some degree to be immune. Some authorities hold that the
immunity against leprosy is due to the fact that the disease
has exhausted itself in the English race. However that may
be, we know that immunity, entire or partial, exists. Children,
again, are susceptible to certain diseases and insusceptible
to certain others to which older people are susceptible.
We know, too, that some individuals have a marked protection
against some diseases. Some people coming into
the way of infection at once fall victims to the disease, whilst
others appear to be proof against it. It is only in recent
times that any very intelligent explanations have been
offered to account for this phenomenon. The most recent
of these, and that which appears to have most to substantiate
it, is known as immunity due to <em>antitoxins</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span></p>

<p><em>The products of bacteria</em> are chiefly six:</p>

<p>1. <em>Pigment.</em> We have already seen how many organisms
exhibit their energy in the formation of many coloured pigments.
They are, as a rule, "innocent" microbes. Oxygen
is required for some, darkness for others, and they all vary
according to the medium upon which they are growing.
Red milk, yellow milk, and green pus afford examples of
pigment produced by bacteria.</p>

<p>2. <em>Gas.</em> Quite a number of the common bacteria, like
<em>Bacillus coli</em>, produce gas in their growth; hydrogen (H),
carbonic acid (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), and even nitrogen
(N) being formed by different bacteria. Many gases produced
during fermentative processes are the result, not
directly of the growth of the bacillus causing the fermentation,
but indirectly owing to the splitting up of the fermenting
fluids.</p>

<p>3. <em>Acids.</em> Lactic, acetic, butyric, etc., are common types
of acids resulting from the growth of bacteria.</p>

<p>4. <em>Liquefying Ferment.</em> As we have seen, bacteria may
be classified with regard to their behaviour in gelatine
medium, whether or not they produce a peptonising ferment
which liquefies the gelatine.</p>

<p>5. <em>Phosphorescence.</em> Some species of bacteria in sea-water
possess the power of producing light.</p>

<p>6. <em>Organic Chemical Products.</em> When a pathogenic bacillus
grows either in the body or in a test-tube, it produces as
a result of its metabolism certain poisonous substances called
<em>toxins</em>. These may occur in the blood as a direct result of
the life of the bacillus, or they may occur as the result of a
ferment produced by the bacillus. They are of various
kinds according to the various diseases, and by their effect
upon the blood and body tissues they cause the symptoms
of the disease in question. We know, for instance, that a
characteristic symptom common to many diseases is fever.
Now, fever is produced by the action of the albumoses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
(bodies allied to the proteids) upon the heat-regulating
centres in the brain. Whenever we get a bacillus growing
in the body which has the power of producing a toxin
albumose, we get fever as a result of that product acting
upon the brain. Albumoses, as a matter of fact, cause a
number of symptoms and poisonous effects, but the mention
of one as an illustration will suffice. Toxins act, roughly
speaking, in two ways:</p>

<p>(1) They have a local action, as, for example, in the formation
of an abscess. The presence of the causal bacteria in
the tissue brings about very marked changes. There is a
multiplication of connective-tissue corpuscles, an emigration
of leucocytic cells, a congestion of blood corpuscles. All
these elements assist in creating a swelling and redness, and
pain by the subsequent pressure upon the delicate nerve
endings. These, as we all know, are the symptoms of a
"gathering" or abscess. It is a "gathering" in a strict
pathological sense&mdash;a gathering of cells to oust the intruder
or build around it a wall or capsule as a protective measure.
Now the toxin will commence its local action. The oldest
cells in the mass of congestion will be caused to break down
into liquid; what is called a <em>necrosis</em>, or death, will rapidly
set in; and we shall have the connective-tissue cells, leucocytes,
blood corpuscles, etc., losing their form and function,
and "coming to a point" as matter, or <em>pus</em>. The local
breaking down of these gatherings of cells into fluid matter
is believed to be the work, not of the bacteria themselves,
but of their toxins.</p>

<p>(2) Toxins may be absorbed and distributed generally
throughout the body. They produce degenerative changes
in muscles, in organs, and in the blood itself. Let us take
diphtheria as an example. The bacillus occurs in a false
membrane in the throat and occasionally other parts. It
causes first the inflammatory condition giving rise to the
membrane, and then it breaks it down. In the body of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
membrane the bacillus appears to secrete a ferment which
by its action and interaction with the body cells and proteids,
chiefly those of the spleen, produces <em>albumoses</em> and an
<em>organic acid</em>. These latter bodies are the toxins. They
are absorbed, and pass throughout the body. There are
albumoses, therefore we get the frequent pulse and high
temperature of fever; the toxins irritate the mucous membrane
of the intestine, and cause various fermentative
changes in the contents of the intestine, therefore we get
the symptoms of diarrh&oelig;a; they penetrate the liver, spleen,
and kidney, therefore we get fatty degeneration and its results
in these organs; they finally affect many of the motor
and sensory nerves, breaking up their axis cylinders into
globules, and therefore we get the characteristic paralysis.
Loss of weight naturally follows many of these degenerative
or wasting changes. Here, then, we have some of the chief
changes set up by the toxins, and these changes constitute
the leading symptoms in the disease as it is known
clinically.</p>

<p>In addition to the presence of the specific bacillus in the
membrane, we also have a number of other organisms, like
the <em>Bacillus coli</em>, <em>Coccus Brissou</em>, <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em>, and
various staphylococci, diplococci, etc. Each of these produces
or endeavours in the midst of keen competition and
strife to produce, its own specific effect. Thus we obtain
the complications of diphtheria, for example various suppurative
and septic conditions. The whole of this compound
process we may tabulate roughly as follows<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a>:</p>

<p>Such is the general effect of toxins in diphtheria. The
same principles apply with equal force in tetanus, typhoid,
etc., the only differences being in degree of virulence, mode
of onset, and portions of the body chiefly affected.</p>

<p>Sidney Martin has recently<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> elaborated the views announced
by him in 1892, and it is right that reference should
be made to his new classification of bacterial poisons. This
may be represented as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table style="font-size: .8em;" summary="bacterial poisons" border="0"><tr>
<td class="tdl"><p class="indent2">1. The poisons secreted by the bacterium itself = (ferment? toxin?)</p></td>

<td class="tdl vertt" colspan="2"><p class="indent2">4. Poisons present in the bodies of the bacillus</p></td>
<td class="tdl vertt">= Intracellular<br />bacterial poisons.</td>
</tr></table>

<p>The poisons of bacteria are, according to Sidney Martin,
of a kind which cannot be fully expressed chemically, but
only pathologically. They may be of a ferment nature in
diphtheria and tetanus. The arguments in support of that
view are&mdash;(1) that they act in infinitesimal doses, (2) that
they may act slowly and produce death after many days by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>profoundly affecting the general nutrition, and (3) that they
are sensitive to the action of heat in a way that no chemical
poisons are known to be. If they are considered as ferments,
they must be substances which have a peculiar affinity
for certain tissues of the body on which they produce
their special toxic effect. As for the products of digestion,
they are formed either by the bacillus ingesting the proteid
and discharging it as albumose, or the digestion occurs by
means of a ferment secreted by the bacillus in the body of
an individual or animal suffering from the disease.</p>

<p>Sidney Martin suggests that <em>anthrax</em> produces albumoses
and an alkaloidal substance, the former producing fever, the
latter stupor. In <em>tetanus</em> the bacillus produces a secretion
of the bacillus which causes the convulsions. The albumoses
present in this disease are probably due to the secretory
toxin. In <em>diphtheria</em>, too, we have a secretory poison in
the membrane and in the tissues, and an albumose which is
possibly the result of the secretion. It will be seen that
these views differ in some particulars from those to which
we have already referred.</p>

<p>However the details of the <em>modus operandi</em> of the formation
of toxins are finally settled, we know that there comes
a time when the disease symptoms vanish, the disease declines,
and the patient recovers. Many of the older schools
of medicine explained this satisfactory phenomenon by
saying that this disease exhausted itself after having "gone
through" the body. In a sense that idea is probably true;
but recently a large number of investigators have applied
themselves to this problem, and with some promising results.</p>

<p>Various protective inoculations against anthrax were practised
as early as 1881, and the protected animals remained
healthy. In 1887 Wooldridge succeeded in protecting rabbits
from anthrax by a new method, by which he showed
that the growth of the anthrax bacillus in special culture
fluids gave rise to a substance which, when inoculated, con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>ferred
immunity. In 1889 and 1890 Hankin and Ogata
worked at the subject, and announced the discovery in the
blood of animals which had died of anthrax of some substances
which appeared to have an antagonistic and neutralising
effect upon the toxins of anthrax and upon the anthrax
bacilli themselves. These substances, they afterwards
found, were products of the anthrax bacillus. Behring and
Kitasato arrived at much the same results for tetanus and
diphtheria. The next step was to isolate these substances,
and, separating them from the blood, investigate still further
their constitution. A number of workers were soon occupied
at this task, and since 1891 Buchner, Hankin, the
Klemperers, Roux, Sidney Martin, and others have added
to our knowledge respecting these toxin-opposing bodies
known as <em>antitoxins</em>. In diphtheria, as we have seen, the
toxins turned out to be soluble bodies allied to the proteids,
albumoses, and an organic acid. Then arose the question
of the source of antitoxins. Some believed they were a
kind of ultratoxin&mdash;bodies of which an early form was a
toxin; others held that, as the toxins were products of
the bacteria invading the tissues, the antitoxins were of the
nature of ferments produced by the resisting tissues.
Finally, they came to be looked upon as protective substances
produced <em>in the body cells</em> as a result of toxin action,
and held in solution in the blood, and there and elsewhere
exerting their influence in opposition to the toxins.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> The
progress of disease is therefore a struggle between the toxins
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>and the antitoxins: when the toxins are in the ascendency
we get an increase of the disease; when the antitoxins are
in the ascendency we get a diminution of disease. If the
toxins triumph, the result is death; if the antitoxins and
resistance of the tissues triumph, the result is recovery.</p>

<p>We may now consider shortly how these new facts were
received and what theories of explanation were put forward
to explain continued insusceptibility to disease. It had of
course been known for a long time past that one attack of
small-pox, for example, in some degree protected the individual
from a subsequent attack of the same disease. To
that experience it was now necessary to add a large mass
of experimental evidence with regard to toxins and antitoxins.
The theories of immunity were as follows:</p>

<p>1. <em>The Exhaustion Theory.</em> The supporters of this idea
argued that bacteria of disease circulating in the body exhausted
the body of the supply of some substance or condition
necessary for the growth and development of their own
species.</p>

<p>2. <em>The Retention Theory.</em> It was surmised that there were
certain products of micro-organisms of disease retained in
the body after an attack which acted antagonistically to the
further growth in the body of that same species.</p>

<p>3. <em>The Acquired Tolerance Theory.</em> Some have advanced
the theory that, after a certain time, the human tissues acquired
such a degree of tolerance to the specific bacteria or
their specific products that no result followed their action in
the body. The tissues become acclimatised to the disease.</p>

<p>4. <em>The Phagocyte Theory.</em> This theory, which gained so
many adherents when first promulgated by Metschnikoff,
attributes to certain cells in the tissues the powers of
"scavenging," overtaking germs of disease, and absorbing
them into their own protoplasm. This, indeed, may be
actually witnessed, and had been observed before the time
of Metschnikoff. But it was he who applied it to disease.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
He came to the conclusion that the successful resistance
which an animal offered to bacteria depended upon the
activity of these scavenging cells, or <em>phagocytes</em>. These
cells are derived from various cellular elements normally
present in the body: leucocytes, endothelial cells, connective-tissue
corpuscles, and any and all cells in the body which
possess the power of ingesting bacteria. If they are present
in large numbers and active, the animal is insusceptible to
certain diseases; if they are few and inactive, the animal is
susceptible.</p>

<p>It appears that the bacteria or other foreign bodies in the
blood which are attacked by the phagocyte become assimilated
until they are a part of the phagocyte itself. Metschnikoff
explained also how it comes to pass that the
phagocyte is able to encounter bacteria when both are circulating
through the blood. It is guided in this attack
upon the organisms by a power termed <em>chemiotaxis</em>. The
bacteria elaborate a chemical substance which attracts the
phagocyte, and this is termed "positive chemiotaxis."<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>
But it may occur that the chemical substance produced by
the bacteria may have an opposite, or repellent, effect upon
the leucocytes, in which case we have "negative chemiotaxis."<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a>
It is not to be wondered at that such a theory of
immunity based upon microscopical observations, should at
first have been widely accepted, and there can be no doubt
that Metschnikoff has collected a considerable mass of evidence
in support of a theory of phagocytosis. But when it
came to be known that blood serum, from which all leucocytes
(phagocytes) had been removed, possessed the same
immunising effect as before, it was clear that such effect was
a property of the serum <em>per se</em>, and not only or wholly due
to the scavenging power of certain cells in it. Even the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>phagocyte theory depends largely for its validity upon
chemiotaxis, which latter was a property of the products of
the bacteria contained in the blood serum.</p>

<p>5. <em>The Antitoxin Theory.</em> We have gathered, then, that
whenever bacteria, introduced into the blood and tissues,
fail to multiply or produce infection (as in saprophytic
bacteria, or in immunity of a particular animal from a specific
microbe), this inability to perform their rôle is brought
about by some property in the living and normal blood
serum which opposes their life and action; and further we
have learned that this protective property is exhaustible according
to the number of bacteria, and differs with various
species of bacteria, and in different animals. Buchner
designates these protective bodies, held in solution in the
blood, <em>alexines</em>, and regards them as belonging to the albuminous
bodies of the lymph and plasma. Where the blood
and tissues do not possess this power, the animal is susceptible.
Now, as we have already seen from the experiments
of Ogata, Kitasato, and others, the blood of an animal dead
of anthrax is protective against anthrax, from which and
the foregoing it appears that microbes produce by their
growth in the tissues poisonous substances we term <em>toxins</em>,
which have the power of producing in the blood and body
cells substances inimical to themselves, named <em>antitoxins</em>,
and so long as these latter substances remain in the tissues
the body remains insusceptible to further attacks of the
same disease. Alexines are <em>naturally</em> produced antitoxins;
antitoxins are <em>acquired</em> alexines. Hence we have the well-known
terms "natural" and "acquired immunity." Of the
former we have already spoken. <em>Acquired immunity</em> is a
protection not belonging to the tissues of individuals naturally
and as part of their constitution, but it is acquired
during their lives as a further accomplishment, so to speak,
of their tissues. This may happen in one or both of two
ways. Either it may be an involuntary acquired immunity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
or a voluntary acquired immunity. For example, the
former is at once illustrated by an attack of the disease.</p>

<p>Small-pox, typhoid fever, even scarlet fever, are diseases
which very rarely attack the same individual twice. That
is because each of these diseases leaves behind it, on its first
appearance, its antitoxic influence. Hence the individual
has <em>involuntarily</em> acquired immunity against these diseases.
An example of voluntary acquired immunity is also at hand
in the old method of preventive inoculation for small-pox,
or <em>variolation</em>. This was clearly an inoculation setting up
an artificial and mild attack of small-pox, by which the
antitoxins of that disease were produced, and protected the
individual against further infection of small-pox; that is to
say, it was a voluntary acquired immunity. This form of
artificial production of protection is generally called <em>artificial
immunity</em>. Let us now marshal together these various

<p>It is hoped that previous remarks will have explained the
meaning of the terms used in the above table, with the
exception of the last two phrases of active and passive immunity.
We propose now to consider in some detail the
four illustrations quoted under these two headings, viz.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
vaccination, Pasteur's treatment of rabies, anti-cholera inoculation,
and antitoxin inoculation. From all accounts, it
is to be feared that these four phases of artificial immunity
are hopelessly confused in the educated public mind. Nor
is this to be wondered at when we reflect upon the rapid
growth of the whole science of immunity, and upon the ever-varying
forms of nomenclature through which it has passed.</p>

<p><em>Vaccination for Small-pox.</em> In 1717 Lady Mary Wortley
Montagu<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> described the inoculation of small-pox as she had
seen it practised in Constantinople. So greatly was she impressed
with the efficacy of this process that she had her
own son inoculated there, and in 1721 Mr. Maitland, a surgeon,
inoculated her daughter in London. This was the
first time inoculation was openly practised in England.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> For
one hundred and twenty years small-pox inoculation (or
<em>variolation</em>, as it is more correctly termed) was practised in
England, until by Act of Parliament in 1840 it was prohibited.</p>

<p>There were different ways of performing variolation, but
the most approved method was similar to the modern system
of arm-to-arm vaccination, the arm being inoculated with a
lancet in one or more places with small-pox lymph instead
of, as now, with vaccine lymph. As a rule, only local results
or a mild attack of small-pox followed, which prevented
an attack of natural small-pox. Its disadvantage is apparent
on the surface. It was a means of breeding small-pox, for
the inoculated cases were liable to create fresh centres of
infection. In 1796 Edward Jenner, who was a country
practitioner in Gloucestershire, observed that those persons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>affected with cow-pox, contracted in the discharge of their
duty as milkers, did not contract small-pox, even when
placed in risk of infection. Hence he inferred that inoculation
of this mild and non-infectious disease would be preferable
to the process of variolation then so widely adopted
in England. Jenner therefore suggested the substitution of
cow-pox lymph (vaccine) in place of small-pox lymph, as in
ordinary variolation.</p>

<p>It should not be forgotten that variolation was thus the
first work done in this country in producing artificial immunity,
and was followed by vaccination, which was only
partly understood. Even to-day there is probably much to
learn respecting it. Both variolation and vaccination may
be described as <em>active immunisation by means of an attenuated
form of the specific virus causing the disease</em>. The nature of
the specific virus of both small-pox and cow-pox awaits discovery.
Burdon Sanderson, Crookshank, Klein, and Copeman
have all demonstrated bacteria in cow-pox or vaccine
lymph, and in 1898 Copeman announced that he had isolated
a specific bacillus and grown it upon artificial media.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a>
Numerous statements have been made to the effect that a
specific bacillus has been found in small-pox also. But
neither in small-pox nor cow-pox is the nature of the contagion
really known.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<p>These facts, however, do not remove the suspicion which
has hitherto rested upon vaccine lymph as a vehicle for bacteria
of other diseases which by its inoculation may thus be
contracted. A few remarks are therefore called for at this
juncture upon the recent work of Dr. Monckton Copeman
and Dr. Frank Blaxall in respect to what is known as <em>glycerinated
calf lymph</em>. Evidence has been forthcoming to sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>stantiate
in some measure the distrust which many of the
public have from time to time felt in the vaccine commonly
used in vaccination, hence the new form as above designated.
This retains the toxic qualities required for immunity, but
is so produced that it possesses in addition three very
important advantages; namely, it is entirely free from
extraneous organisms, it is available for a large number of
vaccinations, and it retains full activity for eight months.
It is prepared as follows:</p>

<p>A calf, aged three to six months, is kept in quarantine
for a week. If then found upon examination to be quite
healthy, it is removed to the vaccination station, and the
lower part of its abdomen antiseptically cleaned. The
animal is now vaccinated upon this sterilised area with
glycerinated calf lymph. After five days the part is again
thoroughly washed, and the contents of the vesicle, which
have of course appeared in the interval, are removed with a
sterilised sharp spoon, and transferred to a sterilised bottle.
This is now removed to the laboratory, and the exact weight
of the material ascertained. A calf thus vaccinated will
yield from 18 to 24 grams of vaccine material. This is now
thoroughly triturated and mixed with six times its weight
of a sterilised solution of 50 per cent. chemically pure
glycerine in distilled water. The resulting emulsion is
aseptically stored in sealed tubes in a cool place. For four
weeks it is carefully examined bacteriologically until the
glycerine has absolutely killed any possible germ that may
have obtained entrance. When by agar plates it is demonstrably
sterile it is ready for distribution.</p>

<p><em>Pasteur's Treatment of Rabies.</em> Rabies is a disease affecting
dogs (in Western Europe) and wolves (in Russia), and
can be transmitted to other animals and man, infection being
carried by the bite of a rabid animal. It takes two chief
forms: (1) furious rabies and (2) paralytic rabies. The
former is more common in dogs. The animal becomes rest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>less,
has a high-toned bark, and snaps at various objects.
Sometimes it exhibits depraved appetite; spasms of the
throat follow, and these soon develop into convulsions,
which are followed by coma and death. In man the incubation
period is fortunately a very long one, averaging about
forty days. Nervous irritability is the first sign; spasms
occur in the respiratory and masticatory muscles, and the
termination is similar to rabies in the dog. The symptom
of fear of water is a herald of coming fatality.</p>

<p>Although a number of the workers at the Pasteur Institute
and elsewhere have addressed themselves to the detection
of a specific microbe, none has as yet been found, although,
in the opinion of Pasteur, such an agent may be suspected
as the cause.</p>

<p>Pathologically rabies and tetanus (see page 168) are closely
allied diseases, and the recent remarkable additions to our
knowledge of the latter disease only make the similarity
more evident. There are in rabies three chief sets of <em>post-mortem</em>
signs. First, and by far the most important, are the
changes in the nervous system. Here we find patches of
congestion in the brain, and breaking down of the axis
cylinders of the nerves. The stomach, in the second place,
exhibits h&aelig;morrhagic changes, not unlike acute arsenical
poisoning. Thirdly, the salivary glands show a degenerative
change in a breaking down of their secreting cells.
Roux has pointed out that in life the saliva of a mad dog
becomes virulent three days before the appearance of the
symptoms of disease.</p>

<p>We may now turn to the method of treatment which was
introduced by Pasteur. Before his time cauterisation of the
wound was the only means adopted. If more than half an
hour has elapsed since the bite, cauterisation is of little or
no avail. The basis for Pasteur's treatment was the difference
in virulence obtainable in spinal cords infected with
rabies. Pasteur found that drying the cord led to a lessen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>ing
of its virulence, just as certain other conditions increased
its virulence. Next he established the fact that subcutaneous
injection of a weak virus, followed up with doses of
ever-increasingly virulent cords, immunised dogs against
infection or inoculation of fully virulent material. From
this he reasoned that if he could establish a standard of
weakened virulence he would have at hand the necessary
"vaccine" for the treatment of the disease.</p>

<p>Subsequent research and skilled technique resulted in a
method of securing this standard, which he found to be a
<span class="figright200">
<img src="images/i_b_255.jpg" width="200" height="293" alt="Suspended Spinal Cord In drying jar containing Calcium Chloride" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Suspended Spinal Cord</span><br />
<small>In drying jar containing Calcium Chloride</small></span></span>
spinal cord dried for fourteen
days. The exact details are as
follows: The spinal cords of two
rabbits dead of rabies are removed
from the spinal canal in their entirety
by means of snipping the
transverse processes of the vertebrae.
Each cord is divided into
three more or less equal pieces,
and each piece, being snared by a
thread of sterilised silk, is carefully
suspended in a sterilised glass
jar. At the bottom of the jar
is a layer, about half an inch
deep, of sterilised calcium
chloride. The jars are then
removed to a dark chamber,
where they are placed at a
temperature of 20&ndash;22&deg;&nbsp;C. in
wooden cases. Here they
are left to dry. Above each case is a tube of broth, to
which has been added a small piece of the corresponding
cord, in order to test for any organismal element that may
by chance be included. In case of the slightest turbidity
in the broth, the cord is rejected. Fourteen series of cords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
are thus suspended on fourteen consecutive days. The
first, second, and third are found to be of practically equal
virulence, but from the third to the fourteenth the virulence
proportionately decreases, and on the fifteenth day the cord
would be practically innocuous and non-virulent. When
treatment is to be commenced, obviously the weakest&mdash;that
is, the fourteenth day&mdash;cord is used to make the "vaccine,"
and so on in steadily increasing doses (as regards virulence)
up to and including a third-day cord. The fourteenth-day
cord is therefore taken, and a small piece cut off and macerated
in 10 cc. of sterile broth, which are placed in a conical
glass and covered with two layers of thick filter-paper, the
glass with its covering having been previously sterilised by
dry heat. When the patient bitten by the rabid animal is
prepared, 3 cc. of this broth emulsion of spinal cord are inoculated
by means of a hypodermic needle into the flanks
or abdominal wall. On the following day the patient returns
for an inoculation of a cord of the thirteenth day, and so on
until a rabid cord emulsion of the first three days has been
inoculated. As a matter of practice, the dosage depends
upon the three recognised classes of bites, viz. (1) bites
through clothing (least severe); (2) bites on the bare skin
of the hand; (3) bites upon the face or head, most severe
owing to the vascularity of these parts. An example of
each, which the writer was permitted to take in the Pasteur
Institute, may be here added to make quite clear the entire
practice. (See page <a href="#Page_258">258.</a>)</p>

<p>It may be well to add the returns of inoculation made at
the Pasteur Institute, Rue Dutot, Paris, as above described.

<p>Pasteur's treatment of rabies by inoculation of emulsions of
dried spinal cord is, therefore, a "vaccination" of attenuated
virus, resulting in antitoxin formation, to the further
protection of the individual against rabies.</p>

<p>One further example of the modern application of the
principles of active acquired immunity may be shortly mentioned.
We refer to the cholera and plague vaccinations.
The vaccination in small-pox is an inoculation of the <em>virus
of the disease</em>; the rabies inoculation is a transmission of the
<em>vital products of the disease attenuated</em>; the plague and
cholera vaccinations are inoculations of <em>pure cultures of living
virus</em> from outside the body. Inoculating cholera virus
against cholera has been made illegal, as variolation was
in 1840. But Haffkine has prepared two vaccines. The
weak one is made from pure cultures of Koch's spirillum of
Asiatic cholera, attenuated by growth to several generations
on agar or broth at 39&deg;C. The strong one is from similar
culture the virulence of which has been increased. One
cubic centimetre of the first vaccine is injected hypodermically
into the flank, and the second vaccine three or four
days afterwards. The immunisation is prophylactic, not
remedial, and its action takes effect five or six days after
the second vaccine has been injected.</p>

<p><br />In plague the same plan has been followed. Luxurious
crops of Kitasato's plague bacillus are grown on ordinary
nutritive media plus large quantities of fat. The fat of
milk, as clarified butter, is that generally used. Under the
globules of fat flakes of culture grow like stalactites, hanging
down into the clear broth. These are in time shaken to the
bottom, and a second crop grows on the under-surface of the
fat. In the course of a month perhaps half a dozen such
crops are obtained and shaken down into the fluid, until the
latter assumes an opaque milky appearance. This is now,
unlike the cholera vaccine, exposed to a temperature of 70&deg;
C., by which the microbes are killed. The culture contains
all the toxins, and the dose is 3 cc. This preparation has
the advantage of being easily prepared, obtainable in large
quantities, and requires no animals in its preparation.
When inoculated it produces local pain and swelling at the
site of inoculation, and general reactive symptoms such as
fever. From a careful analysis of the results of this inoculation,
it is shown that the efficacy of the prophylactic depends
upon the virulence of the bacillus culture from which
the vaccine is prepared, and upon its dose and ability to
produce a well-marked febrile reaction. It appears to be
more effective in the prevention of deaths than of attacks.</p>

<p>The anti-typhoid vaccination is another example of inoculation
to secure active immunity. It is needless, perhaps,
to point out that all these vaccinations, except rabies,
are prophylactic, and not curative.</p>

<p><em>Passive Immunity; Preparation of Antitoxins.</em> We must
now consider the question of passive immunity. This, it
will be remembered, may be defined as a protection (against
a bacterial disease) produced by inoculation, not of the disease
itself, as in small-pox inoculation, nor yet of its weakened
toxins, as in rabies, but of the <em>antitoxins</em> produced in
the body of an animal suffering from that particular disease.
Examples of this treatment are increasing every year, and
the term "antitoxin" has now become almost a household<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
word. The chief examples are to be found in diphtheria,
tetanus, streptococcus, and pneumococcus.</p>

<p>To be of value, antitoxins must be used as early as possible,
before tissue change has occurred and before the
toxins have, so to speak, got the upper hand. When the
toxins are in the ascendency the patient suffers more and
more acutely, and may succumb before there has been time
for the formation in his own body of the antitoxins. If he
can be tided over the "crisis," theoretically all will be well,
because then his own antitoxin will eventually gain the
upper hand. But in the meantime, before that condition
of affairs, the only way is to inject antitoxins prepared in
some animal's tissues whose disease began at an earlier date,
and thus <em>add</em> antitoxins to the blood of our patient, early
in the disease, and the earlier the better, for, however soon
this is done, it is obvious that the toxins begin their work
earlier still. It should not be necessary to add that general
treatment must also be continued, and indeed local germicidal
treatment, <em>e. g.</em>, of the throat in diphtheria and the
poisoned wound in tetanus. Further, in a mixed infection,
as in glandular abscesses with diphtheria, it must be borne
in mind that the antitoxin is specific and may therefore
probably fail in such mixed cases.</p>

<p>After these preliminary remarks we will now consider
shortly some of the methods employed for the production
of antitoxins. An animal is required from whose body a
considerable quantity of blood can be drawn without injurious
effect. Moreover, it must be an animal that can stand
an attack of such diseases as diphtheria and tetanus. Such
an animal is the horse. Now, by injecting into the horse
(<em>a</em>) living organisms of the specific disease, but in non-fatal
doses, or (<em>b</em>) dead cultures, or (<em>c</em>) filtered cultures containing
no bacteria and only the toxins, we are able to produce in
the blood of the horse first the toxins and then the antitoxins
of the disease in question. The non-poisonous doses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
living organisms can be weakened, or, as we say, attenuated,
by various means. Dead cultures have not been much used
to produce immunity except by Pfeiffer. In actual practice
the third method is much the most general, viz., filtering a
fluid culture free from the bacteria, and then inoculating
this in ever-increasing doses. The preparation of diphtheria
antitoxin may be taken as an example, but what follows
would be equally applicable to other diseases, such as tetanus.</p>

<p>1. <em>To Obtain the Toxin.</em> First grow a pure culture of the
Klebs-Löffler bacillus of diphtheria in large flasks containing
"Löffler's medium," or a solution made by mixing
three parts of blood serum with one of beef broth and adding
one per cent. of common salt (Na Cl) and one per cent.
of peptone. An alkaline medium is preferable. The flask
<span class="figright150">
<img src="images/i_b_261.jpg" width="150" height="174" alt="Flask used for the Preparation of
the Toxin of Diphtheria" />
<span class="caption">Flask used for the Preparation of
the Toxin of Diphtheria</span></span>
was thoroughly sterilised before use, and is
now plugged with sterile cotton-wool and incubated
at 77&deg;&nbsp;C. for three or four weeks.
Pure air may be passed over the culture
periodically, thereby aiding the growth.
After the lapse of about a month a scum of
diphtheria growth will have appeared
over the surface of the fluid. This is
now filtered into sterilised flasks, and
some favourable antiseptic added to
ensure that nothing foreign to the
toxin shall flourish, and the flasks are
kept in the dark. Here, then, we
have the product, the toxin, ready for injection into the horse.</p>

<p>2. <em>Immunisation of the Horse.</em> It is evident that only
healthy horses are of service in providing healthy antitoxin,
even as healthy children are necessary in arm-to-arm vaccination.
To provide against any serious taint the horse is
tested for glanders (with mallein) and for tuberculosis (with
tuberculin). The dose of the injection of toxin is at the
commencement about 1/10 cc., or a little more. The site of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
the inoculation is the apex of the shoulder, which has been
antiseptically cleaned. A mere prick is the whole operation.
After the first injection there is generally a definite febrile
reaction and a slight local swelling. From 1/10 or 1/2 cc. the
dose is steadily increased, until at the end of two or three
months<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> perhaps as much as 300 cc. (or even half a litre)
may be injected without causing the reaction which the
initial injection of 1/10 cc. caused at the outset. This shows
an acquired tolerance of the tissues of the horse to the toxic
material. After injecting 500 cc. into the horse without
bad effect, the animal has a rest of four or five days.</p>

<p>3. <em>To Obtain the Antitoxin.</em> During this period of rest
the interaction between the living body cells of the animal
and the toxins results in the production in the blood of an
antitoxin. By means of a small sterilised cannula, five, or
eight, or even ten litres of blood are drawn from the jugular
vein of the horse into sterilised flasks or jars. The top
of the jar is closed by two paper coverings before it is
sterilised. Then it is again covered with a further loose
one. Before use the loose one is removed and replaced by
a metal (zinc) lid, which has been separately sterilised. This
metal lid contains an aperture large enough for the tube
which conveys the blood from the cannula to pass through.
The tube, therefore, passes through the metal lid and two
paper covers, which it was made to pierce. When enough
blood has passed into the vessel the tube is withdrawn, and
the metal lid slightly turned. Thus the contained blood is
protected from the air.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span></p>

<p>The jar containing the blood (which contains the antitoxin)
is next placed in a dark, cool cellar, where it stands
for two or three days. During this time the blood naturally
coagulates, the corpuscles falling as a dense clot to the bottom,
and the faintly yellow serum rising to the top. The
serum, or <em>liquor sanguinis</em>, averages about 50 per cent. of
the total blood taken. Sometimes antiseptics are added
with a view to preservation. It is generally filtered before
bottling for therapeutic use, and sometimes examined
bacteriologically as a test of purity.</p>

<p>4. <em>The Use of Antitoxins.</em> The antitoxins are now ready
for injection into the patient who has contracted diphtheria,
and in whose blood toxins are in the ascendency and under
which the individual may succumb. They are injected in
varying doses, as we have already pointed out.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> The general
result is that mortality has been greatly lessened,
and that in fatal cases there has been a considerable lengthening
of the period of life. Moreover, the whole clinical
course of the disease has been greatly modified, and suffering
lessened.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br /><br />

<small><em>BACTERIA AND DISEASE</em></small></h2>

<p>Probably the most universally known fact respecting
bacteria is that they are related in some way to the
production of disease. Yet we have seen that it was not as
disease-producing agents that they were first studied. Indeed,
it is only within comparatively the latest period of the
two centuries during which they have been more or less
under observation that our knowledge of them as causes of
disease has assumed any exactitude or general recognition.
Nor is this surprising, for although an intimate relationship
between fermentation and disease had been hinted at in the
middle of the seventeenth century, it was not till the time
of Pasteur that the bacterial cause of fermentation was experimentally
and finally established.</p>

<p>In the middle of the seventeenth century men learned,
through the eyes of Leeuwenhoek, that drops of water contained
"moving animalcules." A hundred years later
Spallanzani demonstrated the fact that putrefaction and
fermentation were set up in boiled vegetable infusions when
outside air was admitted, but when it was withheld from
these boiled infusions no such change occurred. Almost a
hundred years more passed before the epoch-making work
of Tyndall and Pasteur, who separated these putrefactive
germs from the air. Quickly following in their footsteps
came Davaine and Pollender, who found in the blood of
animals suffering from anthrax the now well-known specific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
and causal bacillus of that disease. Improvements in the
microscope and in methods of cultivation (Koch's plate
method in particular) soon brought an army of zealous investigators
into the field, and during the last twenty years
first this disease and then that have been traced to a bacterial
origin. We may summarise the vast mass of historical,
physiological, and pathological research extending from
1650 to 1898 in three great periods: the period of detection
of living, moving cells (Leeuwenhoek and others in the
seventeenth century); the period of the discovery of their
close relationship to fermentation and putrefaction (Spallanzani,
Schulze, Schwann, in the eighteenth century); and,
thirdly, the period of appreciation of the rôle of bacteria in
the economy of nature and in the production of disease
(Tyndall, Pasteur, Lister, Koch, in the nineteenth).</p>

<p>But we must look less cursorily at the growth of the idea
of bacteria causing disease. More than two hundred years
ago Robert Boyle (1627&ndash;91), the philosopher, who did so
much towards the foundation of the present Royal Society,
wrote a learned treatise on <cite>The Pathological Part of Physic</cite>.
He was one of the earliest scientists to declare that a relationship
existed between fermentation and disease. When
more accurate knowledge was attained respecting fermentation,
great advance was consequently made in the etiology
of disease. The preliminary discoveries of Fuchs and others
between 1840 and 1850 had relation to the existence in diseased
tissues of a large number of bacteria. But this was
no proof that such germs <em>caused</em> such diseases. It was not
till Davaine had inoculated healthy animals with bacilli from
the blood of an anthrax carcass, and had thus produced the
disease, that reliance could be placed upon that bacillus as
the <em>vera causa</em> of anthrax. Too much emphasis cannot be
laid upon this idea, that unless a certain organism <em>produces</em>
in healthy tissues the disease in question, it cannot be considered
as proven that the particular organism is related to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
the disease as cause to effect. In order to secure a standard
by which all investigators should test their results, Koch introduced
four postulates. Until each of the four has been
fulfilled, the final conclusion respecting the causal agent
must be considered <em>sub judice</em>. The postulates are as
follows:</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) The organism must be demonstrated in the circulation
or tissues of the diseased animal.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) The organism thus demonstrated must be cultivated
in artificial media outside the body, and successive generations
of a <em>pure culture</em> of that organism must be obtained.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) Such pure cultures must, when introduced into a
healthy and susceptible animal, produce the specific disease.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) The organism must be found and isolated from the
circulation or tissues of the inoculated animal.</p>

<p>It is evident that there are some diseases&mdash;for example,
cholera, leprosy, and typhoid&mdash;which are not communicable
to lower animals, and therefore their virus cannot be made
to fulfil postulate (<em>c</em>). In such cases there is no choice.
They cannot be classified along with tubercle and anthrax.
Bacteriologists have little doubt that Hansen's bacillus of
leprosy is the cause of that disease, yet it has not fulfilled
postulates (<em>b</em>) and (<em>c</em>). Nor has the generally accepted
bacillus of typhoid fulfilled postulate (<em>c</em>), yet by the majority
it is <em>provisionally</em> accepted as the agent in producing
typhoid. Hence it will be seen that, though there is an
academical classification of causal pathogenic bacteria according
as they respond to Koch's postulates, yet nevertheless,
there are a number of pathogenic bacteria which are
looked upon as causes of disease provisionally. Anthrax
and tubercle, with perhaps the organisms of suppuration,
tetanus, plague, and actinomycosis, stand in the first order
of pathogenic germs. Then comes a group awaiting
further confirmation. It includes the organisms related to
typhoid, cholera, malaria, leprosy, diarrh&oelig;a,and pneumonia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
Then comes in a third category, a long list of diseases, such
as scarlet fever, small-pox, rabies, and others too numerous
to mention, in which the nature of the causal agent is still
unknown. Hence it must not be supposed that every disease
has its germ, and without a germ there is no disease.
Such universal assertions, though not uncommonly heard,
are devoid of accuracy.</p>

<p>In the production of bacterial disease there are two factors.
First, there is the body tissue of the individual; secondly,
there is the specific organism.</p>

<p>Whatever may be said hereinafter with regard to the
power of micro-organisms to cause disease, we must understand
one cardinal point, namely, that bacteria are never
more than causes, <cite>for the nature of disease depends upon the
behaviour of the organs or tissues with which the bacteria or
their products meet</cite> (Virchow). Fortunately for a clear conception
of what "organs and tissues" mean, these have
been reduced to a common denominator, the cell. Every
living organism, of whatever size or kind, and every organ
and tissue in that living organism, contains and consists of
cells. Further, these cells are composed of organic chemical
substances which are not themselves alive, but the mechanical
arrangement of which determines the direction and power
of their organic activity and of their resistance to the specific
agents of disease. With these facts clearly before us, we
may hope to gain some insight into the reasons for departure
from health.</p>

<p>The normal living tissues have an inimical effect upon
bacteria. Saprophytic bacteria of various kinds are normally
present on exposed surfaces of skin or mucous membrane.
Tissues also which are dead or depressed in vitality from
injury or previous disease, but which are still in contact
with the tissues, afford an excellent nidus for the growth of
bacteria. Still these have not the power, unless specific, to
thrive in the normal living tissue. It has been definitely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
shown that the blood fluids of the body have in their fresh
state the germicidal power (<em>alexines</em>) which prevents bacteria
from flourishing in them. Such action does undoubtedly
depend in measure upon the number of germs as well as
their quality, for the killing power of blood and lymph must
be limited. Buchner has pointed out that the antagonistic
action of these fluids depends in part possibly upon phagocytosis,
but largely upon a chemical condition of the
serum. The blood, then, is no friend to intruding bacteria.
Its efforts are to a certain extent seconded by the lymphoid
tissue throughout the body. Rings of lymphoid tissue
surround the oral openings of the trachea (windpipe) and
&oelig;sophagus (gullet); the tonsils are masses of lymphoid
tissue. Composed as it is of cells having a germicidal influence
when in health, the lymphoid tissue may afford
formidable obstruction to intruding germs.</p>

<p>All the foregoing points in one direction, namely, that if
the tissues are maintained in sound health, they form a very
resistant barrier against bacteria. But we know from experience
that a full measure of health is not often the happy
condition of human tissues; we have, in short, a variety of
circumstances which, as we say, <em>predispose</em> the individual to
disease. One of the commonest forms of predisposition is
that due to <em>heredity</em>. Probably it is true that what are
known as hereditary diseases are due far more to a hereditary
predisposition than to any transmission of the virus itself in
any form. <em>Antecedent disease</em> predisposes the tissues to form
a nidus for bacteria; <em>conditions of environment or personal
habits</em> frequently act in the same way. Damp soils must be
held responsible for many disasters to health, not directly,
but indirectly, by predisposition; dusty trades and injurious
occupations have a similar effect. Any one of these three
different influences may in a variety of ways affect the
tissues and increase their susceptibility to disease. Not infrequently
we may get them combined. For example, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
following is not an unlikely series of events terminating in
consumption (tuberculosis of the lungs):&mdash;(<em>a</em>) The individual
is predisposed by inheritance to tuberculosis; (<em>b</em>) an ordinary
chronic catarrh, which lowers the resisting power of the
lungs, may be contracted; (<em>c</em>) the epithelial collections in
the air vesicles of the lung&mdash;<em>i. e.</em>, dead matter attached to
the body&mdash;afford an excellent nidus for bacteria; (<em>d</em>) owing
to occupation, or personal habits, or surroundings, the
patient comes within a range of tubercular infection, and
the specific bacilli of tubercle gain access to the lungs. The
result, it is needless to state, will be a case of consumption
more or less acute according to environment and treatment.</p>

<p>The <em>channels of infection</em> by which organisms gain the
vantage-ground afforded by the depressed tissues are various,
and next to the maintenance of resistant tissues they call for
most attention from the physician and surgeon. It is in
this field of preventive medicine&mdash;that is to say, preventing
infective matter from ever entering the tissues at all&mdash;that
science has triumphed in recent years. It is, in short, applied
bacteriology, and therefore claims consideration in this
place.</p>

<p>1. <em>Pure Heredity.</em> By this term may be understood the
actual transmission from the mother to the unborn child of
the specific virus of the disease. That such a conveyance
may occur is generally admitted by pathologists, but it is
impossible to enter fully into the matter in such a book as
the present. Summarily we may say that, though this sort
of transmission is possible, it is not frequent, nor is disease
appreciably spread through such a channel. Sixty per cent.
of consumptives, it has been estimated, have tuberculous
progenitors, and this is the highest figure. Many would be
justified from experience in placing it at half that number.</p>

<p>2. <em>Inoculation</em>, or inserting virus through a broken surface
of skin, is itself a sufficiently obvious mode of infection to
call for little comment. Yet it is under this heading that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
a word must be said of that remarkable application of preventive
medicine known as the antiseptic treatment of
wounds. When Lord Lister was Professor of Surgery in
Glasgow, he was impressed with the greatness of the evil of
putrefaction in wounds, which was caused, not by the
oxygen of the air, as Liebig had declared, but by the entrance
into the wound of fermentative organisms from the
air. This was demonstrated by Pasteur, who pointed out
that they could not arise <em>de novo</em> in the wound. Hence it
appeared to Lister that these fermentative bacteria which
produce putrefaction in wounds must either be kept out of
the wound altogether, or killed, or their action prevented,
in the wound. To keep air away from wounds is an almost
impossible task, and thus it came about that wounds were
dressed with a solution of carbolic acid.</p>

<p>From time to time examples occur of bacterial disease
being directly inoculated in wounds made with polluted instruments,
or in cuts made by contaminated broken glass,
or in gunshot wounds. Tetanus is, of course, one of the
most marked examples.</p>

<p>3. <em>Contagion</em> is a term which has suffered from the many
ways in which it has been used. Defined shortly and most
simply, we should say a disease is <em>contagious</em> when it can be
"caught" by contact, through the unbroken surfaces, between
diseased and healthy persons. Ringworm is an
example, and there are many others.</p>

<p>4. <em>The Alimentary Canal: Food.</em> The recent Royal
Commission on Tuberculosis has collected a large mass of
evidence in support of the view that tubercle may be spread
by articles of food. Milk and meat from tuberculous animals
naturally come in for the largest amount of condemnation.
To these matters we refer elsewhere.</p>

<p>5. <em>The Respiratory Tract: Air.</em> The air may become infected
with germs of disease from dusty trades, dried
sputum, etc. If such infected air be inhaled, pathogenic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
results will follow, especially if the bacteria are present in
sufficient numbers, or meet with devitalised, and therefore
non-resisting, tissues.</p>

<p>These, then, are the five possible ways in which germs
gain access to the body tissues. The question now arises,
How do bacteria, having obtained entrance, set up the process
of disease? For a long time pathologists looked upon
the action of these microscopic parasites in the body as
similar to, if not identical with, the larger parasites sometimes
infesting the human body. Their work was viewed
as a devouring of the tissues of the body. Now, it is well
known that, however much or little of this may be done,
the specific action of pathogenic bacteria is of a different
nature. It is twofold. We have the action of the bacteria
themselves, and also of their products or toxins. In particular
diseases, now one and now the other property comes
to the front. In bacterial diseases affecting or being transmitted
mostly by the blood, it is the toxins which act
chiefly. The convenient term <em>infection</em> is applied to those
conditions in which there has been a multiplication of living
organisms after they have entered the body, the word <em>intoxication</em>
indicating a condition of poisoning brought about
by their products. It will be apparent at once that we may
have both these conditions present, the former before the
latter, and the latter following as a direct effect of the
former. Until intoxication occurs there may be few or no
symptoms, but directly enough bacteria are present to produce
in the body certain poisons in sufficient amount to
result in more or less marked tissue change, then the symptoms
of that tissue change appear. This period of latency
between infection and the appearance of the disease is
known as the <em>incubation period</em>. Take typhoid, for example.
A man drinks a typhoid-polluted water. For about fourteen
days the bacilli are making headway in his body without
his being aware of it. But at the end of that incubation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
period the signs of the disease assert themselves. Professor
Watson Cheyne and others have maintained that there is
some exact proportion between the number of bacteria
gaining entrance and the length of the incubation period.</p>

<p>Speaking generally, we may note that pathogenic bacteria
divide themselves into two groups: those which, on entering
the body, pass at once, by the lymph or blood stream,
to all parts of the body, and become more and more diffused
throughout the blood and tissues, although in some cases
they settle down in some spot remote from the point of entrance,
and produce their chief lesions there. Tubercle and
anthrax would be types of this group. On the other hand,
there is a second group, which remain almost absolutely
local, producing only little reaction around them, never
passing through the body generally, and yet influencing the
whole body eventually by means of their ferments or toxins.
Of such the best representatives are tetanus and diphtheria.
The local site of the bacteria is, in this case, the local manufactory
of the disease.</p>

<p>Whilst the mere bodily presence of bacteria may have
mechanical influence injurious to the tissues (as in the small
peripheral capillaries in anthrax), or may in some way act
as a foreign body and be a focus of inflammation (as in
tubercle), the real disease-producing action of pathogenic
bacteria depends upon the <em>chemical poisons</em> (toxins) formed
directly or indirectly by them. Though within recent years
a great deal of knowledge has been acquired about the
formation of these bodies, their exact nature is not known.
They are allied to albuminous bodies and proteoses, and are
frequently described as tox-albumens. It may be found,
after all, that they are not of a proteid nature. Sidney
Martin has pointed out that there is much that is analogous
between the production of toxins and the production of the
bodies of digestion. Just as ferments are necessary in the
intestine to bring about a change in the food by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
the non-soluble albumens shall be made into soluble peptones
and thus become absorbed through the intestinal wall,
so also a ferment may be necessary to the production of
toxins. Such ferments have not as yet been isolated, but
their existence in diphtheria and tetanus is, as we have
seen, extremely likely. However that may be, it is now
more or less established that there are two kinds of toxic
bodies, differing from each other in their resistance to heat.
It may be that the one most easily destroyed by heat is a
ferment and possibly an originator of the other. A second
division which has been suggested for toxic bodies, and to
which reference has been made, is <em>intracellular</em> and <em>extracellular</em>,
according to whether or not the poison exists
within or without the body of the bacillus.</p>

<p>Lastly, we may turn to consider the action of the toxins
on the individual in whose body-fluids they are formed. It
is hardly necessary to say that any action which bacteria or
toxins may have will depend upon their virulence, in some
measure upon their number, and not a little upon the channel
of infection by which they have gained entrance. It
could not be otherwise. If the virulence is attenuated, or
if the invasion is very limited in numbers, it stands to reason
that the pathogenic effects will be correspondingly small or
absent. The influence of the toxins is twofold. In the
first place (i.) they <em>act locally upon the tissues</em> at the site of
their formation, or at distant points by absorption. There
is inflammation with marked cell-proliferation, and this is,
more or less rapidly, followed by a specific cell-poisoning.
The former change may be accompanied by exudation, and
simulate the early stages of abscess formation; the latter is
the specific effect, and results, as in leprosy and tubercle,
in infective nodules. The site in some diseases, like typhoid
(intestinal ulceration, splenic and mesenteric change) or
diphtheria (membrane in the throat), may be definite and
always the same. But, on the other hand, the site may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
depend upon the point of entrance, as in tetanus. The
distant effects of the toxin are due to absorption, but what
controls its action it is impossible to say. We only know
that we do find pathological conditions in certain organs at
a distance and without the presence of bacteria. We have
a parallel in the action of drugs; for example, a drug may
be given by the mouth and yet produce a rash in some distant
part of the body. In the second place (ii.) toxins
produce <em>toxic symptoms</em>. Fever and many of the <em>nervous
conditions resulting</em> from bacterial action must thus be classified.
We have, it is true, the chemical symptoms of the
pathological tissue change, for example, the large spleen of
anthrax or the obstruction from diphtheritic membrane.
But, in addition to these, we have general symptoms, as
fever, in which after death no tissue change can be formed.</p>

<p>We may now consider briefly some of the more important
types of disease produced by bacteria:</p>

<p><b>1. Tuberculosis.</b><a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> As far back as 1794 Baillie drew
attention to the grey miliary nodules occurring in tuberculous
tissue which gave rise to the term "tubercles."
This preliminary matter was confirmed by Bayle in 1810.</p>

<p>In 1834 Laennec described all caseous deposits as "tubercles,"
insisting upon four varieties:</p>

<p>(1) Miliary, which were about the size of millet seeds, and
in groups;</p>

<p>(2) Crude, miliary tubercles in yellow masses;</p>

<p>(3) Granular, similar to the last, but scattered;</p>

<p>(4) Encysted, a hard mass of crude tubercle with a fibrous
or semi-cartilaginous capsule.</p>

<p>The tubercle possesses in many cases a special structure,
and certain cell-forms frequently occur in it and give it a
characteristic appearance. The central part of the tubercle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>usually contains <em>giant cells</em> with numerous nuclei. The
uninuclear cells are partly lymphoid, partly large epithelial
or endothelial cells; these are called <em>epithelioid</em> cells.</p>

<p>It was not till 1865 that the specific nature of tuberculosis
was asserted by Villemin. Burdon Sanderson (1868&ndash;69) in
England confirmed his work, and it was extended by Connheim,
who a few years later laid down the principle that all
is tubercular which by transference to properly constituted
animals is capable of inducing tuberculosis, and nothing is
tubercular unless it has this capability.</p>

<p>Klebs (1877) and Max Schiller (1880) described masses of
living cells or micrococci in many tuberculous nodules in
the diseased synovial membrane and in lupus skin. In 1881
Toussaint declared he had cultivated from the blood of
tubercular animals and from tubercles an organism which
was evidently a micrococcus, and in the same year Aufrecht
stated that the centre of a tubercle contained small micrococci,
diplococci, and some rods. But it was not till the
following year, 1882, that Koch discovered and demonstrated
beyond question the specific <em>Bacillus tuberculosis</em>.</p>

<p>It is now held to be absolutely proved that the introduction
of the bacillus, or its spores or products, is the one and
only essential agent in the production of tuberculosis. Its
recognised manifestations are as follows:</p>

<p>The disease may occur generally throughout the body or
locally in the suprarenal capsules, prostate, intestine, larynx,
membranes of the heart, bones, ovaries, pleura, kidneys,
spleen, testicles, Fallopian tubes, uterus, etc.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span></p>
<p>We may summarise the history of the pathology of
tubercle thus:</p>

<p class="indent3">1794. Baillie drew attention to grey miliary nodules occurring
in tuberculosis, and called them "tubercles."</p>

<p class="indent3">1834. Laennec described four varieties: <em>miliary</em>; <em>crude</em>;
<em>granular</em>; <em>encysted</em>.</p>

<p class="indent3">1843. Klencke produced tuberculosis by intravenous injection
of tubercular giant cells.</p>

<p class="indent3">1865. Villemin demonstrated infectivity of tubercular
matter by inoculation of discharges; Connheim,
Armanni, Burdon Sanderson, Wilson Fox, and
others showed that nothing but tubercular matter
could produce tuberculosis.</p>

<p class="indent3">1877. Living cells were found in tubercles, "micrococci"
(Klebs, Toussaint, Schiller).</p>

<p class="indent3">1882. Koch isolated and described the specific bacillus,
and obtained pure cultivations (1884).</p>

<p><em>The Bacillus of Koch</em>, 1882. Delicate cylindrical rods,
measuring 1.5&ndash;4 micromillimetres in length and about .2 µ
in breadth; non-motile. Many are straight with rounded
ends; others are slightly curved. They are usually solitary,
but may occur in pairs, lying side by side or in small masses.
They are chiefly found in fresh tubercles, more sparingly in
older ones. Some lie within the giant cells; others lie outside;
shorter in tissue sections of bovine tuberculosis, but
longer in the milk (Crookshank).</p>

<p>When stained they appear to be composed of irregular
cubical or spherical granules within a faintly stained sheath.
In recent lesions the protoplasm appears more homogeneous,
and takes on the segmented or beaded character only in old
lesions, pus, or sputum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span></p>

<p>Morphological differences are found under different circumstances,
and within limits variation occurs according to
the environment.</p>

<p><em>Cultivation on Various Media.</em> Koch inoculated <em>solid blood
serum</em> with tubercular matter from an infected lymphatic
gland of a guinea-pig, and noticed the first signs of growth
in ten or twelve days in the form of whitish, scaly patches.
These enlarged and coalesced with neighbouring patches,
forming white, roughened, irregular masses. Nocard and
Roux showed that by adding 5/8 per cent. of glycerine to the
media commonly used in the laboratory, such as nutrient
agar or broth, the best growth is obtained.</p>

<p>On <em>glycerine broth</em> or <em>glycerine agar</em> abundant growth appears
at the end of seven or eight days. By continuous
sub-culture on glycerine agar the virulence of the bacillus is
diminished. But in fifteen days after inoculation of the
medium the culture equals in extent a culture of several
weeks' age on blood serum.</p>

<p>Sub-cultures from glycerined media will grow in ordinary
broth without glycerine (Nocard, Roux, Crookshank).</p>

<p>In <em>alkaline broth</em> to which a piece of boiled white of egg
was added Klein obtained copious growths, and found that
continued sub-culturing upon this medium also lessens the
virulence.</p>

<p><em>Description of Cultivations:</em>&mdash;On glycerine agar minute
white colonies appear in about six days, raised and isolated,
and coalescing as time advances, forming a white lichenous
growth, fully developed in about two months.</p>

<p>On glycerine broth a copious film appears on the surface
of the liquid, which if disturbed falls to the bottom of the
flask as a deposit.</p>

<p><em>Spore Formation.</em> In very old cultivations spore-like
bodies can be observed both in stained and unstained preparations,
but neither the irregular granules within the capsule
nor the unstained spaces between the granules are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
spores (Babes and Crookshank). That the bacilli possess
spores is believed on account of the following facts:</p>

<p>1. That tubercular sputum, when thoroughly dried, maintains
its virulent character (Koch, Schill, Fischer, etc.). No
sporeless bacillus is known which can survive through
drying.</p>

<p>2. That tubercular matter and cultures survive temperature
up to 100&deg;&nbsp;C. Non-spore-bearing bacilli and micrococci
are killed by being exposed for five minutes to a
temperature of 65&ndash;70&deg;&nbsp;C., whereas spores of other bacilli
withstand much higher temperatures.</p>

<p>3. Tubercular sputum distributed in salt solution does
not lose its virulence by being kept at 100&deg;&nbsp;C. for one or
two minutes; sporeless bacilli certainly would (Klein).</p>

<p>4. A solution of per-chloride of mercury does not kill the
tubercle bacilli, as it does sporeless bacilli (Lingard and
Klein).</p>

<p>Koch and many bacteriologists have declared the bacillus
to be a "true parasite." Koch based this view upon the
belief which he entertained that the bacillus can grow only
between 30&deg;&nbsp;C. and 41&deg;&nbsp;C., and therefore in temperate
zones is limited to the animal body and can originate only
in an animal organism. "They are," he said, "true parasites,
which cannot live without their hosts. They pass
through the whole cycle of their existence in the body."
But at length Koch and others overcame the difficulties and
grew the bacillus as a saprophyte.</p>

<p>Schottelius<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> has observed that tubercle bacilli taken from
the lung of phthisical persons buried for years still retains
its virulence and capability of producing tuberculosis upon
inoculation. He further shows that tubercular lung kept
in soil (enclosed in a box) shows a marked rise in temperature.
Klein quotes these experiments as indications that
"<i>tubercle bacilli are not true parasites, but belong to the ecto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>genic
microbes which can live and thrive independent of a
living host</i>."</p>

<p>It has now been abundantly proved that the bacillus of
tuberculosis is capable of accommodating itself to circumstances
much less favourable than had been supposed,
especially as regards temperature.</p>

<p><em>Temperature of Growth of Bacillus.</em> 30&ndash;41&deg;&nbsp;C. have been
laid down by Koch as the limits of temperature at which the
bacillus will grow in culture medium outside the body. The
generally accepted temperatures as most favourable to
the growth of the bacillus are between 36&deg;&nbsp;C. and 38&deg;&nbsp;C.</p>

<p>Sir Hugh Beevor, however, was able to grow the bacillus
upon glycerine agar at 28&deg;&nbsp;C. (82&deg;&nbsp;F.), obtaining an ample
culture which developed somewhat more slowly than on
blood serum, and to a less extent than at 37&deg;&nbsp;C. In both
Beevor succeeded in growing the bacillus at a lower temperature
even than on agar, viz., at a temperature rarely above
60&deg;&nbsp;F. Sheridan Delépine and others have also been successful
in obtaining growths at room temperature both in
summer and winter.</p>

<p>Although, speaking generally, there is an actual cessation
of growth at low temperature, the bacillus may be exposed
to very low temperatures for a considerable time without
losing its power of again becoming active when returned to
a favourable environment (Woodhead).</p>

<p><em>The Relation of the Bacillus to the Disease.</em> All four of
Koch's postulates have been fulfilled in the case of <em>Bacillus
tuberculosis</em>. Hence we are dealing with the specific cause
of the disease. Yet, whilst this is so, we may usefully ask
ourselves: <em>How</em> does the bacillus set up the changes in
normal tissues which result in tubercular nodules? In
arriving at a solution of this problem we are materially aided
if we bear in mind the fact that such an organism in healthy
tissues has a double effect. First, there is an ordinary inflammatory
irritation, and secondly, there is a specific change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
set up by the toxins of the bacillus. Directly the invading
bacilli find themselves in a favourable nidus they commence
multiplication. In three or four days this acts as an irritant
upon the surrounding connective-tissue cells, which proliferate,
and become changed into large cells known as <em>epithelioid
cells</em>. At the periphery of this collection of epithelioid cells
we have a congested area. This change has been accomplished
by the presence of the bacilli themselves. The production
of their specific poisons changes the epithelioid cells
in the centre of the nodule, some of which become fused
together, whilst others expand and undergo division of
nucleus. By this means we obtain a series of large multi-nucleated
cells named <em>giant cells</em>. If the disease is very
active, these soon caseate and break down in the centre.
In a limb we get a discharge; in a lung we get an expectoration.
Both discharge and expectoration arise from a breaking
down of the new cell formation. Previously to breaking
down we have in a fully developed nodule healthy tissue,
inflammatory zone, epithelioid cells, giant cells, containing
nuclei and bacilli. The sputum or the discharge will, during
the acute stage of the disease at all events, contain
countless numbers of the bacilli, which may thus be readily
detected, and their presence used as evidence of the disease.
It is obvious that if the centre of the nodule degenerates
and comes away as discharge a cavity will be left behind.
By degrees this small cavity may become a very large one,
as is frequently the case in the lung, which particularly
lends itself to such a condition. Hence, though at the outset
a tubercular lung is solid, at the end it is hollow.</p>

<p>The exact period of giant-cell formation depends on the
rapidity of the formative processes. Thus different conditions
occur. Inside the giant cells the bacilli are arranged
in relation to the nuclei in one of three ways: (<em>a</em>) polar, (<em>b</em>)
zonal, or (<em>c</em>) mixed. The breaking down of the nodule is
partly due to the cell-poisons, and partly because the nodule
is non-vascular, owing to the fact that new capillaries cannot
grow into the dense nodule, and the old ones are all
occluded by the growth of the nodule.</p>

<p>From the local foci of disease the tubercle process spreads
chiefly by three channels:</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) <em>By the lymphatics</em>, affecting particularly the glands.
Thus we get tuberculosis set up in the bronchial, tracheal,
mediastinal, and mesenteric glands, and it is so frequently
present as to be a characteristic of the disease. This is the
common method of dissemination in the body.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) <em>By the blood-vessels</em>, by means of which bacilli may be
carried to distant organs.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) <em>By continuity of tissues</em>, infective giant-cell systems
encroaching upon neighbouring tissues, or discharge from
lungs or bronchial glands obtaining entrance to the gullet
and thus setting up intestinal disease also.</p>

<p>It has been abundantly proved that the respiratory and
digestive systems are principally affected by Koch's bacillus.
Wherever the bacilli are arrested, they excite formation of
granulations or miliary tubercular nodules, which increase
and eventually coalesce. The lymphatic glands which collect
the lymph from the affected region are the earliest
affected, always the nearest first, and then the disease appears
to be appreciably stopped on its invading march.
Each lymphatic gland acts as a temporary barrier to progress
until the disease has broken its structure down. It
remains local, in spite of increase in number and importance
of the foci of disease, as long as the bacilli have not gained
access to the blood stream.</p>

<p><em>Toxins and Tuberculin.</em> Koch, Crookshank, and Herroun,
Hunter, and others have isolated products from pure cultures
of the tubercle bacillus. These have comprised chiefly
<em>albumoses</em>, <em>alkaloids</em>, and various <em>extractives</em>. Koch's observations
led him to suppose that in pure cultures of tubercle
a substance appeared having healing action on tuberculosis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
and an extract of this in glycerine he termed "tuberculin."
It was made as follows: A veal broth containing peptone
and glycerine was inoculated with a pure culture of the
bacillus and incubated at 38&deg;&nbsp;C. for six or eight weeks. An
abundant growth with copious film formation appeared.
The culture was then concentrated by evaporation over a
water-bath until reduced to about one-tenth of its volume.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_b_282.jpg" width="200" height="118" alt="Flask used in the Preparation of Tuberculin" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Flask used in the Preparation of Tuberculin</span></p></div>

<p>The announcements in 1890 and 1891 to the effect that a
"cure" had been discovered for consumption will be remembered.
The hopes thus raised were unfortunately not
to be realised. Koch advocated injections of this tuberculin
in cases of skin tubercle (lupus) and consumptive cases. In
many of these benefit was apparently derived, but its general
application was not founded upon any substantial basis.
Dead tissue, full of bacilli, could not thus be got rid of; nor
could the career of the isolated bacilli distributed through
the body be thus checked.</p>

<p>Tuberculin has, however, found a remarkable sphere of
usefulness in causing reaction in animals suffering from
tuberculosis. Indeed, tuberculin is the most valuable means
of diagnosis that we possess (MacFadyen). When injected
(dose, 30&ndash;40 centigrammes) it causes a rise of one and a half
to three degrees. The fever begins between the twelfth and
fifteenth hour after injection, and lasts several hours. The
duration and intensity of the reaction have no relation to
the number and gravity of the lesions, but the same dose
injected into healthy cattle causes no appreciable febrile
reaction. The tuberculous calf reacts just as well as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
adult, but the dose is generally 10&ndash;20 centigrammes. Injections
of tuberculin have no troublesome effect on the
quantity or quality of the milk of cows or on the progress
of gestation.</p>

<p><em>Tuberculosis of Animals.</em> Cattle come first amongst
animals liable to tubercle. Horses may be infected, but it
is comparatively rare, and among small ruminants the disease
is rarer still. Dogs, cats, and kittens may be easily
infected. Amongst birds, fowls, pigeons, turkeys, and
pheasants, the disease assumes almost an epidemic character.
Especially do animals in confinement die of tubercle, as is
illustrated in zo&ouml;logical gardens. Respecting the lesions of
bovine tuberculosis, it will be sufficient to say that nothing
is more variable than the localisation or form of its attacks.
The lungs and lymphatic glands come first in order of frequency,
next the serous membranes, then the liver and
intestines, and lastly the spleen, joints, and udder (Nocard).</p>

<p>The anatomical changes in bovine tubercle are mostly
found in the lungs and their membranes, the pleur&aelig;. It
also affects the internal membrane lining, the abdomen and
its chief organs, the peritoneum, and the lymphatic glands.
In both these localities a characteristic condition is set up
by small grey nodules appearing, which increase in size,
giving an appearance of "grapes." Hence the condition
is called grape disease, or <em>Perlsucht</em>. The organs, as we have
said, are equally affected, and when we add the lymphatic
glands we have a fairly complete summary of the form of
the disease as it occurs in cattle. As has been clearly
pointed out by Martin, Woodhead, and others in their evidence
before the Royal Commission, the organs, glands,
and membranes are the sites for tubercle, not the muscles
(or "meat"). This latter is most liable to convey infection
when the butcher smears it with the knife which he has
used to remove tubercular organs.</p>

<p>As regards the udder in its relation to milk infection, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
may be desirable to state that the initial lesion, according
to Nocard and Bang, takes the form of a progressive sclerosis.
The interlobular connective tissue, normally scanty,
becomes thickened, fibrous, and infiltrated by minute miliary
granulations. The granular tissue is thus "smothered
by the hypertrophy and fibrous transformation of the interstitial
connective tissue" (Nocard). The walls of the ducts
are thickened and infiltrated, the lumen frequently dilated
by masses of yellow caseous material. On the whole it may
be said that tubercle of the udder is rare. Usually only
one quarter is attacked, and by preference the posterior.
For some time the milk remains normal, but gradually it
becomes serous and yellow, and contains coagula holding
numbers of bacilli. Lastly, it becomes purulent and dries
up altogether. While the milk is undergoing these changes
the lesion of the udder is becoming more marked, the tissue
becomes less supple, and the toughness increases almost to
a wooden hardness.</p>

<p>The general anatomical characteristics of the disease are
similar to those occurring in man.</p>

<p>The percentage of cattle suffering from tubercle varies.
In Germany it appears to vary from 2 to 8 per cent. of all
cattle, in Saxony 17 to 30 per cent., in England 22 per cent.
approximately (in London 40 per cent.), in France 25 per
cent. Lowland breeds are much more infected than mountain
breeds, which possess stronger constitutions.</p>

<p>Tuberculosis of the <em>pig</em> is less common than that of cattle,
but not so rare as that of the calf (Nocard). In nine out of
ten cases the pig is infected by ingestion, particularly when
fed on the refuse from dairies and cheese factories. The
disease follows the same course as in cattle. The finding of
the bacillus is difficult, and the only safe test is inoculation
(Woodhead).</p>

<p><em>Sheep</em> are very rarely tuberculous by nature, though there
is evidence to believe that very long cohabitation with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
tuberculous cattle would succeed in transmitting tuberculosis
to some sheep.</p>

<p>Tuberculosis in the <em>horse</em> is relatively very rare. It attacks
the organs of the abdominal cavity, especially the glands;
it affects the lung secondarily as a rule. The cases are generally
isolated ones, even though the animal belongs to a
stud. Nocard holds that the bacillus obtained from the
pulmonary variety is like the human type, whilst the abdominal
variety is more like the avian bacillus.</p>

<p>Nocard says<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"If the dog can become tuberculous from contact with man,
the converse is equally true. Infection is at any rate possible
when a house-dog scatters on the floor, carpet, or bed, during
its fit of coughing, virulent material, which is rendered extremely
dangerous by drying, especially for children, its habitual playmates.
The most elementary prudence would recommend the
banishment from a room of every dog which coughs frequently,
even though it only seems to be suffering from some common
affection of the bronchi or lung."</p></div>

<p>Tuberculosis is a common disease among the <em>birds</em> of the
poultry-yard: poultry, pigeons, turkeys, pea-fowl, guinea-fowl,
etc. They are infected almost exclusively through
the digestive tract, generally by devouring infected secretions
of previous tubercular fowls. Whatever the position
or form of avian tuberculosis, the bacilli are present in
enormous numbers, and are often much shorter and sometimes
much longer than those met with in tuberculous
mammalia, and grow outside the body at a higher temperature
(43&deg;&nbsp;C.). They are also said to be more resistant and
of quicker growth. The species is probably identical with
Koch's bacillus, though there are differences. In the nodule,
which is larger than in human tuberculosis, there are few or
no giant cells, and it does not so readily break down.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span></p>
<p>Nocard and others have demonstrated the fact that the
<em>Bacillus tuberculosis</em> of Koch is the common denominator in
all tubercular disease, whatever and wherever its manifestations,
in all animals. The bacillus, they hold, may,
however, experience profound modifications by means of
successive passages through the bodies of divers species of
animals. But if the modifications which it undergoes as a
result of transmissions through birds, for example, are profound
enough to make the bacillus of avian tubercle a
peculiar variety of Koch's bacillus, they are not enough, it is
generally believed, to make these bacilli two distinct species.</p>

<p>We may, therefore, take it for granted that tuberculosis
is one and the same disease, with various manifestations,
common to man and animals, intercommunicable, and having
but one <em>vera causa</em>: the <em>Bacillus tuberculosis</em> of Koch.</p>

<p><em>The Prevention of Tuberculosis.</em> At the present time
much attention is being directed to the administrative personal
control of tuberculosis. How greatly this is needed
in so preventable a disease is evident from a perusal of the
following quotation from the Registrar-General's reports.
(See opposite page.)</p>

<p>These figures show a marked decline in the three worst
forms of the disease. But this decline is apparently less
marked in tabes than in phthisis or tubercular meningitis,
<em>i. e.</em>, less in the kind of tubercle due to the ingestion of
infected milk. Fortunately the State is beginning to realise
its duty in regard to preventive measures. The abolition
of private slaughter-houses, the protection of meat and milk
supplies, the seizure of tuberculous milch cows, and such
like measures fall obviously within the jurisdiction of the
State rather than the individual, and claim the earnest and
urgent attention of the public health departments of states.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Bacillus of Diphtheria</span></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span></p>

<p><b>Diphtheria</b> (Klebs-Löffler Bacillus, 1882&ndash;1884). Diphtheria
is an infective disease characterised by a variety of
clinical symptoms, but commonly by a severe inflammation
followed by a fibrous infiltration (constituting a <em>membrane</em>)
of certain parts. The membrane ultimately breaks down.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
The parts affected are the mucous membrane of the fauces,
larynx, pharynx, trachea, and sometimes wounds and the
inner wall of the stomach. The common sign of the disease
is the membrane in the throat; but muscle weakness,
syncope, albuminuria, post-diphtheritic paralysis, convulsions,
and many other symptoms guide the physician in
diagnosis and the course of the disease.</p>

<p>The <em>Bacillus diphtheri&aelig;</em> was isolated from the many bacteria
found in the membrane by Löffler. Klebs had previously
identified the bacillus as the cause of the disease.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
It is a slender rod, straight or slightly curved, and remarkable
for its beaded appearance; there are also irregular and
club-shaped forms. It differs in size according to its culture
medium, but is generally 3 or 4 µ in length. In the membrane
which is its strictly local habitat in the body&mdash;indeed,
the bacillus is found nowhere else in the body&mdash;it almost
invariably shows parallel grouping, lying between the fibrin
of the membrane, and most largely in its deeper parts.
Here it is mixed with other bacilli, micrococci, staphylococci,
and streptococci, all of which are present and performing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
their part in complicating the disease. The bacillus possesses
five negative characters; namely, it has no spores,
threads, or power of mobility, and does not produce liquefaction
or gas. It stains with Löffler's methylene blue, and
shows metachromatic granules and polar staining. Its
favourable temperature is blood-heat, though it will grow at
room temperature. It is aërobic, and, indeed, prefers a
current of air. Löffler contrived a medium for cultivation
which has proved most successful. It is made by mixing
three parts of ox-blood serum with one part of broth containing
1 per cent. of glucose, 1 per cent. of peptone, and 1/2
per cent. of common salt; the whole is coagulated. Upon
this medium the Klebs-Löffler bacillus grows rapidly in
eighteen or twenty hours, producing scattered "nucleated"
round white colonies, becoming yellowish. It grows well
in broth, but without producing either a pellicle or turbidity;
it can grow on the ordinary media, though its growth on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
potato is not visible; on the white of egg it flourishes extremely
well.</p>

<p>It retains its vitality in cultures and sometimes in the
throat for months. Three or four weeks is the average
length of time for its existence in the membrane, but, owing
to the difficulty of killing it <em>in situ</em>, it may live on for as long
as a year. All the conditions in the throat&mdash;mucous membrane,
blood-heat, moisture, air&mdash;are extremely favourable
to the bacillus; but it is very materially modified in virulence.
It is secured for diagnostic purposes by one of two
methods: (<em>a</em>) Either a piece of the membrane is detached,
and after washing carefully examined by culture as well as
the microscope; or (<em>b</em>) a "swab" is made from the infected
throat and cultured on serum, and incubated at 37&deg;&nbsp;C. for
eighteen hours and then microscopically examined. Both
methods&mdash;and there is no further choice&mdash;present some
difficulties owing to the large number of bacteria found in
the throat. Hence a negative result must be accepted with
reserve.</p>

<p>We have already referred at some length to the question
of <em>toxins</em> in diphtheria, and need not dwell further upon
that matter. Still a word or two may be said here summarising
the general action of the bacillus. Locally it produces
inflammatory change with fibrinous exudation and
some cellular necrosis. In the membrane a ferment is
probably produced which, unlike the localised bacilli, passes
throughout the body and by digestion of the proteids produces
albumoses and an organic acid which have the toxic
influence. The toxins act on the blood-vessels, and nerves,
and muscle fibres of the heart, and many of the more highly
specialised cells of the body. Thus we get degenerative
changes in the kidney, in cells of the central nervous system,
in the peripheral nerves (post-diphtheritic paralysis), and
elsewhere, these pathological conditions setting up, in addition
to the membrane, the signs of the disease. The bacil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>lus
is pathogenic for the horse, ox, rabbit, guinea-pig, cat,
and some birds. Cases are on record of supposed infection
of children by cats suffering from the disease. The horse,
it will be remembered, yields the antitoxin which has saved
so many lives (<cite>Metropolitan Asylums Board Report</cite>, 1896).</p>

<p>The influence of drainage, milk, and schools must not be
forgotten by sanitary authorities any more than the essential
importance of adequate isolation hospital accommodation.
Mr. Shattock's experiments on the effect of sewer air
upon attenuated Klebs-Löffler bacilli have been mentioned
(see p. 105). Nevertheless there can be no doubt that
emanations from defective drains have a materially predisposing
effect, not, it is true, upon the bacilli, but upon the
tissues. Sore throats thus acquired are <em>par excellence</em> the
site for the development of diphtheria.</p>

<p>The influence of school attendance has claimed the recent
attention of the Medical Officer of the London School Board
and the Medical Officer of the administrative County of
London. In London since 1881 there has been a marked
increase of diphtheria, which has occurred, though in a much
less degree, throughout England and Wales.</p>

<p>The Registrar-General has only classified diphtheria as a
separate disease since 1855, when the death-rate per 1,000,000
in England and Wales was stated as 20. The following
are the figures for four decades up to 1895:</p>

<p>From these figures the extraordinary increase during the
last few years is clearly demonstrated.</p>

<p>Sir Richard Thorne Thorne, in 1891, drew attention to
the influence of damp soils and schools upon diphtheria.
In 1894 Mr. Shirley Murphy, Medical Officer to the London
County Council, reported that there had been an increase in
diphtheria mortality in London at school ages (three to ten)
as compared with other ages since the Elementary Education
Act became operative in 1871; that the increased mortality
from diphtheria in populous districts, as compared with rural
districts, since 1871, might be due to the greater effect of
the Education Act in the former; and that there was a
diminution of diphtheria in London during the summer
holidays at the schools in 1893, but that 1892 did not show
any marked changes for August.</p>

<p>In 1896 Professor W. R. Smith, the Medical Officer to the
London School Board, furnished a report<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> on this same
subject of school influence, in which he produces evidence
to show that the recrudescence of the disease in 1881&ndash;90 was
greatest in England and Wales at the age of two to three
years, and in London at the age of one to two years, in
both cases <em>before school age</em>; that age as an absolute factor
in the incidence of the disease is enormously more active
than any school influence, and that personal contact is
another important source of infection.</p>

<p>Although it is said that "statistics can be made to prove
anything," there can be little doubt that both of these
reports contain a great deal of truth; nor are these truths
incompatible with each other. They both emphasise <em>age</em> as
a great factor in the incidence of the disease, and whatever
affects the health of the child population, like schools, must
play, directly or indirectly, a not unimportant part in the
transmission of the disease.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span></p>
<p><em>The Pseudo-diphtheria Bacillus.</em><a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> Löffler and Hoffman
described a bacillus having the same morphological characters
as the true <em>Bacillus diphtheri&aelig;</em>, except that it had no
virulence. Roux believes this is merely an attenuated diphtheria
bacillus. It is frequently found in healthy throats.
The chief differences between the real and the pseudo-bacillus
are:</p>

<p>1. The pseudo-bacillus is thicker in the middle than at
the poles, and not so variable as the <em>Bacillus diphtheri&aelig;</em>.
Polar staining is absent.</p>

<p>2. Its growth on potato reveals cream-coloured colonies
visible in a couple of days; the real bacillus is invisible.</p>

<p>3. The pseudo-bacillus will not grow at all anaërobically
in hydrogen, but the <em>Bacillus diphtheri&aelig;</em> is able to do so.</p>

<p>4. There is the great difference in virulence.</p>

<p><b>Suppuration.</b> This term is used to designate that general
breaking down of cells which follows acute inflammation.
An "abscess" or "gathering" is a collection, greater or
smaller, of the products of suppuration. The word <em>pus</em> is
generally used to describe this matter. We may have such
an advanced inflammatory condition in any locality of the
body, and it will assume different characters according to
its site. Hence there are connected with suppuration, as
causal agents, a variety of bacteria. Pus is not matter containing
a pure culture of any specific species, but, on the
contrary, is generally filled with a large number of different
species. The most important are as follows:</p>

<p>1. <em>Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus.</em> These are micrococci
arranged in groups, which have been likened to bunches of
grapes. They are the common organisms found in pus, and
were with other auxiliary bacteria first distinguished as such
by Professor Ogston, of Aberdeen. There are several forms
of the same species, differing from each other in colour.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span></p>
<p>Thus we have the <em>S. pyogenes aureus</em> (golden yellow), <em>albus</em>
(white), <em>citreus</em> (lemon), and others. They occur commonly
in nature, in air, soil, water, on the surface of the skin, and
in all suppurative conditions. The <em>aureus</em> is the only one
credited with much virulence. It occurs in the blood in
blood-poisoning (septic&aelig;mia, py&aelig;mia), and is present in all
ulcerative conditions, including ulcerative disease of the
valves of the heart.</p>

<p>The <em>Staphylococcus cereus albus</em> and <em>S. cereus flavus</em> are
slightly modified forms of the <em>S. pyogenes aureus</em>, and are
differentiated from it by being non-liquefying. They produce
a wax-like growth on gelatine.</p>

<p><em>Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus</em>, the type of the family, is
grown in all ordinary media at room temperature, though
more rapidly at 37&deg;&nbsp;C. Liquefaction sets in at a comparatively
early date, and subsequently we have in the gelatine
test-tube cultures a flocculent deposit of a bright yellow
amorphous mass, and in gelatine plates small depressions
of liquefaction with a yellow deposit. It renders all media
acid, and coagulates milk. Its thermal death-point in gelatine
is 58&deg;&nbsp;C. for ten minutes, but when dry considerably
higher. It is a non-motile and a facultative anaërobe; but
the presence of oxygen is necessary for a bright colour. Its
virulence readily declines.</p>

<p>2. <em>Streptococcus pyogenes.</em> In this species of micrococcus
the elements are arranged in chains. Most of the streptococci
in pus, from different sources, are one species, having
approximately the same morphological and biological characters.
Their different effects are due to different degrees of
toxic virulence; they are always more virulent when associated
with other bacteria, for example, the Proteus family.</p>

<p>The chains vary in length, consisting of more elements
when cultured in fluid media. They multiply by direct
division of the individual elements, and in old cultures it
has been observed that the cocci vary in form and size.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
This latter fact gave support to the theory that streptococcus
reproduced itself by <em>arthrospores</em>, or "mother-cells."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_b_298.jpg" width="400" height="357" alt="Types of Streptococcus" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Types of Streptococcus</span></p></div>

<p>In culture upon the ordinary media streptococcus is comparatively
slow-growing, producing minute white colonies
on or about the sixth day. It does not liquefy gelatine,
and remains strictly localised to the track of the inoculating
needle. Like the staphylococcus, it readily loses virulence.
The thermal death-point is, however, lower: 54&deg;&nbsp;C. for ten
minutes. Marmorek has devised a method by which the
virulence may be greatly increased, and he holds that it depends
upon the degree of virulence possessed by any particular
streptococcus as to what effects it will produce. By the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
adoption of Marmorek's methods attempts have been made
to prepare an antitoxin.</p>

<p><em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em> has been isolated from the membrane
of diphtheria, and from small-pox, scarlet fever, vaccinia,
and other diseases. In such cases it is not the causal
agent, but merely associated with the complications of these
diseases. Suppuration and erysipelas are the only pathological
conditions in which the causal agency of streptococcus
has been sufficiently established.</p>

<p>3. The <em>Bacillus pyocyaneus</em> occurs in green pus, and is
the cause of that colouration. Gessard was the first to prove

<p>It is a minute, actively motile, non-sporulating bacillus,
which occasionally complicates suppuration and produces
green pus. Oxygen is necessary for pigmentation, which is
due to two substances: <em>pyocyanin</em>, a greenish-blue product
extracted with chloroform, and <em>pyoxanthose</em>, a brown substance
derived from the oxidation of the former pigment.
Both these colours are produced in cultivation outside the
body. On gelatine the colour is green, passing on to olive.
There is liquefaction. On potato we generally obtain a
brown growth (compare <em>Bacillus coli</em>, <em>B. mallei</em>, and others).
The organism grows rapidly on all the ordinary media,
which it has a tendency to colour throughout.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that when speaking of the antagonism
of organisms, we referred to the inimical action of
<em>Bacillus pyocyaneus</em> upon anthrax.</p>

<p>4. <em>Micrococcus Tetragonus.</em> This species occurs in phthisi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>cal
cavities and in certain suppurations in the region of the
face. It is a micrococcus usually in the form of small
tetrads. A capsule is always present and sometimes discernible.</p>

<p>5. <em>Bacillus coli communis</em> and many putrefactive germs
commonly occur in suppurative conditions, but they are not
restricted to such disorders (see p. 64).</p>

<p>6. <em>Micrococcus gonorrh&oelig;&aelig;</em> (Neisser, 1879). This organism
is more frequently spoken of as a diplococcus. It occurs at
the acute stage of the disease, but is not readily differentiated
from other similar diplococci except by technical
laboratory methods. Each element presents a straight or
concave surface to its fellow. A very marked concavity
indicates commencing fission. The position which these
diplococci take up in pus is <em>intracellular</em>, and arranged
more or less definitely around the nucleus. Difficulty has
often been found in cultivating this organism in artificial
media outside the body. Wertheim and others have suggested
special formul&aelig; for the preparation of suitable media,
but it is a very simple matter to secure cultures on agar
plates smeared with human blood from a pricked finger.
The plate is incubated at 37&deg;&nbsp;C. At the end of twenty-four
hours small raised grey colonies appear, which at the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
about four days show adult growth. The margin is uneven,
and the centre more opaque than the rest of the
colony. This diplococcus is readily killed, and sub-cultures
must be frequently made to retain vitality and virulence.
Light, desiccation, and a temperature of 55&deg;&nbsp;C. all act germicidally.
The organism stains readily in Löffler's blue, but
is decolourised by Gram's method. It is more or less
strictly parasitic to man. Its shape, size, character of
growth, and staining properties assist in differentiating it
from various similar diplococci.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></p>

<p><b>Anthrax.</b> This disease was one of the first in which the
causal agency of bacteria was proved. In 1849 Pollender
found an innumerable number of small rods in the blood of
animals suffering from anthrax. In 1863 Davaine described
these, and attributed the disease to them. But it was not
till 1876 that Koch finally settled the matter by isolating the
bacilli in pure culture and describing their biological characters.</p>

<p>It is owing in part to its interesting bacterial history,
which opened up so much new ground in this comparatively
new science, that anthrax has assumed such an important
place in pathology. But for other reasons, too, it claims
attention. It appears to have been known in the time of
Moses, and was perhaps the disease described by Homer in
the First Book of the <cite>Iliad</cite>. Rome was visited by it in
740 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Anthrax is an acute disease, affecting sheep, cattle,
horses, goats, deer, and man. Cats, white rats, and Algerian
sheep are immune. Swine become infected by feeding
on the offal of diseased cattle (Crookshank).</p>

<p>The <em>post-mortem</em> signs are mainly three: The <em>spleen</em> is
greatly enlarged and congested, is friable to the touch, and
contains enormous numbers of bacilli; the <em>skin</em> may show
exudations forming dark gelatinous tumours; and the <em>blood</em>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
remains fluid for some time after death, is black, tar-like,
contains bubbles of air, and shows other degenerative
changes in the red corpuscles, whilst the <em>small blood-vessels</em>
contain such vast quantities of bacilli that they may be
ruptured by them. Particularly is this true in the peripheral
arteries. Many of the organs of the body show
marked congestion.</p>

<p>Clinically there is rise of temperature and rapid loss of
muscular power. The <em>bacilli</em> of anthrax are square-ended
rods 1 µ broad and 4&ndash;5 µ long. In the tissues of the body
they follow the lines of the capillaries, and are irregularly
situated. In places they are so densely packed as to form
obstructions to the onward flow of blood. In cultures they
are in chains end to end, having as a rule equal interbacillary
spaces. In cultures long filaments and threads occur.
The exact shape of the bacillus depends, however, upon
two things: the staining and spore formation. Both these
factors may very materially modify the normal shape. The
spores of anthrax are oval endospores, produced only in the
presence of free oxygen, and at any temperature between
18 and 41&deg;&nbsp;C. On account of requiring free oxygen, they
are formed only outside the body. The homogeneous pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>toplasm
of the bacillus becomes granular; the granules
coalesce, and we have spores. Each spore possesses a thick
capsule, which enables it to resist many physical conditions
which kill the bacillus. When the spore is ripe or has exhausted
the parent bacillus, it may take on a resting stage,
or under favourable circumstances commence germination,
very much after the manner of a seed. The spores may infect
a farm for many months; indeed, cases are on record
which appear to prove that the disease on a farm in the
autumn may by means of the spores be carried on by the
hay of the following summer into a second winter. Thus,
by means of the spores, the infection of anthrax may cling
to the land for very long periods, even for years. Spores
of anthrax can withstand 5 per cent. carbolic acid or 1&ndash;1000
corrosive sublimate for more than an hour; even boiling
does not kill them at once, whilst the bacilli without their
spores are killed at 54&deg;&nbsp;C. in ten minutes. When the spores
are dry they are much more resistant than when moist.
Hence the persistence of the anthrax bacillus is due to its
spores.</p>

<p>The bacillus is aërobic, non-motile, and liquefying. Broth
cultures become turbid in thirty-six hours, with nebulous
masses of threads matted together. The pellicle which
forms on the surface affords an ideal place for spore formation.</p>

<p>Cultures in the depth of gelatine show a most characteristic
growth. From the line of inoculation delicate threads
and fibrill&aelig; extend outwards horizontally into the medium.
Liquefaction commences at the top, and eventually extends
throughout the tube. On gelatine plates small colonies
appear in thirty-six hours, and on the second or third day
they look, under a low power of the microscope, like matted
hair. The colonies after a time sink in the gelatine, owing
to liquefaction. On potato, agar, and blood serum anthrax
grows well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span></p>

<p><em>Channels of Infection.</em> 1. <em>The Alimentary Canal.</em> This
is the usual mode of infection in animals grazing on infected
pasture land. A soil suitable for the propagation of anthrax
is one containing abundance of air and proteid material.
Feeding on bacilli alone would probably not produce the
disease, owing to the germicidal effect of the gastric juice.
But spores can readily pass uninjured through the stomach
and produce anthrax in the blood. Infected water as well
as fodder may convey the disease. Water becomes infected
by bodies of animals dead of anthrax, or, as was the case
once at least in the south-west of England, by a stream
passing through the washing-yard of an infected tannery.
Manure on fields, litter in stalls, and infected earth may all
contribute to the transmission of the disease. Darwin
pointed out the services which are performed in superficial
soils by earthworms bringing up casts; Pasteur was of
opinion that in this way earthworms were responsible for
continually bringing up the spores of anthrax from buried
corpses to the surface, where they would reinfect cattle.
Koch disputed this, but more recently Bollinger has demonstrated
the correctness of Pasteur's views by isolating anthrax
contagium from five per cent. of the worms sent him
from an anthrax pasture. Bollinger also maintains that
flies and other insects may convey the disease from discharges
or carcasses round which they congregate.</p>

<p>Alimentary infection in man is a rare form, and it reveals
itself in a primary diseased state known as <em>mycosis intestinalis</em>,
an inflamed condition of the intestine and mesenteric
lymph glands.</p>

<p>2. <em>Through the Skin.</em> Cutaneous anthrax goes by the
name of <em>malignant pustule</em>, and is caused by infective anthrax
matter gaining entrance through abrasions or ulcers
in the skin. This local form is obviously most contracted
by those whose occupation leads them to handle hides or
other anthrax material (butchers and cleaners of hides).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
Two or three days after inoculation a red pimple appears,
which rapidly passes through a vesicular stage until it is a
pustule. Concomitantly we have glandular enlargement,
general malaise, and a high temperature. Thus from a local
sore a general infection may result. Unless this does occur,
the issue will not be fatal, and the bacilli will never gain
entrance into the blood or be anything but local.</p>

<p>3. <em>Respiratory Tract.</em> In man this is the commonest form
of all, and is well known under the term "wool-sorters' disease,"
or pulmonary anthrax. This mode of infection occurs
when dried spores are inhaled in processes of skin-cleaning.
It frequently commences as a local lesion affecting the
mucous membrane of the trachea or bronchi, but it rapidly
spreads, affecting the neighbouring glands, which become
greatly enlarged, and extending to the pleura and lung
itself. Such cases, as a rule, rapidly end fatally.</p>

<p>From what has been said, it will be clear that anthrax
carcasses are better not opened and exposed to free oxygen.
An extended <em>post-mortem</em> examination is not necessary.
Burning the entire carcass in a crematorium would be the
ideal treatment. As such is not generally feasible the next
best thing is to bury the carcass deeply with lime below and
above it, and rail in the area to prevent other animals grazing
off it.</p>

<p>A very small prick will extract enough blood to examine
for the anthrax bacilli which are driven by the force of the
blood-current to the small surface capillaries. This occurs,
of course, only when the disease has become quite general,
for in the early stage the healthy blood limits the bacilli
to the internal organs. In such cases examination of the
blood of the spleen is necessary.</p>

<p>Anthrax covers a wide geographical area all over the
world, and no country seems altogether exempt. In Germany
as many as 3700 animals have been lost in a single year.
About 900 animals were attacked in 1897 in Great Britain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span></p>

<p><b>Plague.</b> This disease, like anthrax and leprosy, has a
long historical record behind it. As the Black Death it
decimated the population of England in the fourteenth
century, and visited the country again in epidemic form in
the middle of the seventeenth century, when it was called
the Great Plague. Now, it is highly probable that these two
scourges and the recent epidemic in the East are all forms
of one and the same disease. As a matter of fact, it is
difficult to be sure what was the exact pathology of a number
of the grievous ailments which troubled our country in
the Middle Ages, but from all accounts bubonic plague and
true leprosy were amongst them. The former came and
went spasmodically, as is its habit; the latter dragged
through the length of several centuries.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_b_306.jpg" width="200" height="186" alt="Bacillus of Plague" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Bacillus of Plague</span></p></div>

<p>The distribution of plague at the present time is fortunately
a somewhat limited one, namely, a definite area in
Asia known as the "Plague Belt." From Mesopotamia,
as a sort of focus, the disease spreads northwards to the
Caspian Sea, westwards to the Red Sea, southwards as far
as Central India, and eastwards as far as the China Sea.
This constitutes the "belt," but the disease may take an
epidemic form, and is readily, though very slowly, conveyed
by infection or contagion. It appears to be infectious by
means of infective dust, and contagious by prolonged and
intimate contact with the plague-stricken. Rats have been
accused of conveying the disease from port to port, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
even infecting man. It is clear that rats are not the only
agency acting in this way. Nevertheless it is true that rats
contract the disease more readily than any other animals,
and that when suffering from it they may spread the infection.
How it is thus spread it is not known. Drs.
Cantlie and Yersin have pointed out that previously to an
epidemic of plague rats die in enormous numbers.</p>

<p>The bacteriology of plague is almost the latest addition
to the science. Kitasato, of Tokio, demonstrated the cause
of plague to be a bacillus during the Hong Kong epidemic
in 1894. This was immediately confirmed by Yersin, and
further proved by the isolation in artificial media of a pure
culture of a bacillus able to cause the specific disease of
bubonic plague.</p>

<p>The bacillus was first detected in the blood of patients
suffering from the disease. It takes the form of a small,
round-ended, oval cell, with marked polar staining, and
hence having an appearance not unlike a diplococcus. In
the middle there is a clear interspace, and the whole is surrounded
with a thick capsule, stained only with difficulty.
The organisms are often linked together in pairs or even
chains, and exhibit involution forms. In culture the bacillus
is even more coccal in form than in the body.</p>

<p>The plague bacillus grows readily on the ordinary media
at blood-heat, producing circular cream-coloured colonies
with a wavy outline, which eventually coalesce to form a
greyish film. The following negative characters help to
distinguish it: No growth occurs on potato, milk is not
coagulated, and gelatine is not liquefied; Gram's method
does not stain the bacillus, and there are no spores; the
bacillus is readily killed by heat and by desiccation over
sulphuric acid at 30&deg;&nbsp;C. Both in cultures and outside the
body the bacillus loses virulence. To this may be attributed
possibly the variety of forms of the plague bacillus which
differ in virulence. On gaining entrance to the human body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
the bacillus affects in particular two organs, the spleen and
the lymph glands. The latter become inflamed in groups,
commencing frequently with those in the armpit (axillary)
or groin (inguinal). The spleen suffers from inflammatory
swelling, which may affect other organs also. In both
places the bacilli occur in enormous numbers. Kitasato
considers that the bacillus may enter the body by the three
channels adopted by anthrax, namely, the skin, alimentary
canal, and respiratory tract.</p>

<p>Haffkine has prepared a vaccine to be used as a prophylactic.
He grows a pure culture of Kitasato's bacillus in
broth upon the surface of which some globules of fat
("ghee") have been placed. The bacillus grows upon this
fat in copious stalactite form. From time to time this
growth is shaken down, until after five or six weeks the
shaken broth appears milky. The contained bacilli are
killed by heating the fluid to 70&deg;&nbsp;C. for one hour. The resultant
is the vaccine, of which the dose is 3 cc. Haffkine
believes that inoculated persons in India have suffered
twenty times less than non-inoculated living under the same
conditions.</p>

<p>Plague is essentially a "filth disease," and it is frequently
preceded by famine. Temperature and overcrowding exert
an influence upon it. The areas affected by the disease in
the Middle Ages, in the seventeenth century, and in 1894&ndash;96
are alike in being characterised by filth and overcrowding.
There is little fear, speaking generally, of the plague
ever flourishing under Western civilisation, where the conditions
are such that even when it appears there is little to
encourage or favour its development.</p>

<p><b>Leprosy.</b> This ancient disease is said to have existed in
Egypt 3500 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and was comparatively common in India,
China, and even in parts of Europe 500 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> We know it
has existed in many parts of the world in the past, in which
regions it is now extinct. Some of the earliest notices we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
have of it in this country come from Ireland, and date back
to the fifth and sixth centuries. Even at that period of
time also various classical descriptions of the disease had
been written and various decrees made by the Church councils
to protect lepers and prevent the spread of the disease,
which was often looked upon as a divine visitation. In the
tenth century leprosy was prevalent in England; it reached
its zenith in the thirteenth century, or possibly a little
earlier, and declined from that date to its extinction in the
sixteenth. But even two hundred years later leprosy was
endemic in the Shetlands, and it is recorded that in 1742
there was held a public thanksgiving in Shetland on account
of the disappearance of leprosy.</p>

<p>At one time or another there were as many as two hundred
institutions in the British Isles for the more or less
exclusive use of lepers. Many of these establishments were
of an ecclesiastical or municipal character, and probably the
exact diagnosis of diseases was a somewhat lax matter.
Bury St. Edmunds, Bristol, Canterbury, London, Lynn,
Norwich, Thetford, and York were centres for lepers. Burton
Lazars and Sherburn, in Durham, were two of the
more famous leper institutions.</p>

<p>At the present time the distribution of the disease is
mostly Asiatic. Norway contains about 1200 lepers, Spain
approximately the same number. Scattered through Europe
are perhaps another 600 or 700, in India 100,000, and a large
number in Japan. The Cape possesses a famous leper hospital
on Robben Island, with a number of patients. The
disease is also endemic in the Sandwich Islands.</p>

<p>Descriptions of the pathological varieties of leprosy have
been very diverse. The classification now generally adopted
includes three forms: the <em>tuberculated</em>, the <em>an&aelig;sthetic</em> (or
maculo-an&aelig;sthetic), and the <em>mixed</em>. <em>Lepra tuberculosa</em> is
that form of the disease affecting chiefly the skin, and
resulting in nodular tuberculated growth or a diffuse infil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>tration.
It causes great disfigurement. The an&aelig;sthetic
form causes a destruction of the nerve fibres, and so produces
an&aelig;sthesia, paralysis, and what are called "trophic"
changes. Not infrequently patches occur on the skin, which
appear like parchment, owing to this trophic change. Bull&aelig;
may arise. When the tissue change is radical or far advanced,
considerable distortion may result. The mixed
variety of leprosy, as its name implies, is a mixture of the
two other forms.</p>

<p>The <em>Bacillus lepr&aelig;</em> was discovered by Hansen in 1874.
He found it in the lepra cells in the skin, lymph glands,
liver, spleen, and thickened parts of the nerves. It is common
in the discharges from the wounds of lepers. It is
conveyed in the body by the lymph stream, and has rarely
been isolated from the blood (Köbner).</p>

<p>The bacillus is present in enormous numbers in the skin
and tissues, and has a form very similar indeed to <em>Bacillus
tuberculosis</em>. It is a straight rod, and showing with some
staining methods marked beading, but with others no beading
at all. It measures 4 µ long and 1 µ broad. Young
leprosy bacilli are said to be motile, but old ones are not.
Neisser has maintained that the bacillus possesses a capsule
and spores. The latter have not been seen, but Neisser
holds that this is the form in which the bacillus gains entrance
to the body. There is a characteristic which fortunately
aids us in the diagnosis of this disease in the tissues,
and that is the arrangement of the bacilli, which are rarely
scattered or isolated, but gathered together in clumps and
colonies. Bordoni-Uffreduzzi and Campania claim to have
isolated the bacillus and grown it on artificial media, the
former aërobically on peptone-glycerine-blood-serum, at
37&deg;&nbsp;C., the latter anaërobically. But no other worker has
been able to do this. Hence we are not able to study the
bacteriology of leprosy at all completely, nor have inoculation
experiments proved successful. Nevertheless there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
little doubt that leprosy is a bacterial disease produced by
the bacillus of Hansen. Bordoni-Uffreduzzi maintains that
the parasitic existence of the <em>Bacillus lepr&aelig;</em> may alternate
with a saprophytic stage. This may be of importance in
the spread of the disease. There is evidence in support of
the non-communicability of the disease by heredity or contagion.
Segregation does not appear always to result in a
decline of the disease, as we should expect if it were purely
contagious. Ehlers, of Copenhagen, has, however, as recently
as 1897, reaffirmed his belief in the contagiousness of
leprosy; Virchow, on the other hand, has declared that it is
not highly contagious. There is evidence to show that persons
far advanced in the disease may live in a healthy community
and yet not infect their immediate neighbours.
Indeed, the transmission of the disease is still an unsolved
problem. Mr. Hutchinson suggests diet, particularly uncooked
or putrid fish, as a likely channel; on the other
hand, leprosy appears in districts where no fish is eaten.
Deficiency of salt, telluric and climatic conditions, racial
tendencies, social status, poverty, insanitation, drinking
water, even vaccination, have all secured support from
various seekers after the true channel by which the bacillus
gains entrance to the human body. The real mode of
transmission is, however, still unknown. The decline and
final extinction of leprosy in the British Islands was probably
due in part to the natural tendency of the disease,
under favourable hygienic circumstances, to die out, and in
part to a general and extensive social improvement in the
life of the people, to a complete change in the poor and insufficient
diet, and to agricultural advancement, improved
sanitation, and land drainage.</p>

<p>At the Leprosy Congress held in Berlin in 1897, Hansen
again emphasised his belief that segregation was the cause
of the decline of leprosy wherever it had occurred. But
there appears to be some evidence to show that leprosy has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
declined where there has been no segregation whatever, and
therefore, however favourable to decline such isolation may
be, it would seem not to be actually necessary to the decline.
At the same Congress Besnier declared in favour of
the infective virus being widely propagated by means of the
nasal secretion. Sticker states that the nasal secretion contains
millions of lepra bacilli, especially in the acute stage
of the disease, and Besnier and Sticker have pointed out how
frequently and severely the septum nasi and skin over the
nose are affected in leprosy. Several leprologists in India
have recorded similar observations. These facts appear to
support Besnier's contention that the disease is spread by
nasal secretion.</p>

<p>We may fitly add here the conclusions arrived at by the
English Leprosy Commission<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> in India:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"1. Leprosy is a disease <em>sui generis</em>; it is not a form of
syphilis or tuberculosis, but has striking etiological analogies with
the latter.</p>

<p>"2. Leprosy is not diffused by hereditary transmission, and,
for this reason and the established amount of sterility among
lepers, the disease has a natural tendency to die out.</p>

<p>"3. Though in a scientific classification of diseases leprosy
must be regarded as contagious, and also inoculable, yet the
extent to which it is propagated by these means is exceedingly
small.</p>

<p>"4. Leprosy is not directly originated by the use of any particular
article of food, nor by any climatic or telluric conditions,

any race or caste.</p>

such as poverty, bad food, or deficient drainage or ventilation,

susceptibility of the individual to the disease.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
<p>"6. Leprosy, in the great majority of cases, originates <em>de novo</em>,

dealt with in the Report, and which are related to each other in
ways at present imperfectly known."</p></div>

<p>The practical suggestions of the Commission for preventive
treatment included voluntary isolation, prohibition of
the sale of articles of food by lepers, leper farms, orphanages,
and "improved sanitation and good dietetic conditions"
generally. Serum-therapy has been attempted on
behalf of the French Academy of Medicine, but without
success. Many forms of treatment ameliorate the miserable
condition of the leper, but up to the present no curative
agent has been found.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Diplococcus of Pneumonia</span></p></div>

<p><b>Pneumonia.</b> Some of the difficulty which has surrounded
the bacteriology of inflammation of the lungs is due to the
confusion arising from supposing that attacks of the disease
differed only in degree. Pneumonia, however, has various
forms, arising now from one cause, now from another. The
specific or croupous pneumonia is associated with two organisms:
Fraenkel's diplococcus and Friedländer's pneumo-bacillus.
Several other bacteria have from time to time
been held responsible for pneumonia, a streptococcus re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>ceiving,
at one time, some support. But whilst opinion is
divided on the rôle of various extraneous and concomitant
bacteria in lung disease, importance is attached to Fraenkel's
and Friedländer's organisms.</p>

<p>The <em>diplococcus</em> of Fraenkel is a small, oval diplococcus
found in the "rusty" sputum of croupous pneumonia. It
is non-motile, non-liquefying, and aërobic. When examined
from cultures the diplococci are frequently seen in chains,
not unlike a streptococcus, and there is some reason to suppose
that this form gave rise to the belief that it was another
species; when examined from the tissues it possesses a capsule,
but in culture this is lost. It is difficult to cultivate,
but grows on glycerine agar and blood serum at blood-heat.
On ordinary gelatine at room temperature it does not grow,
or, if so, very slightly. The ideal fluid is a slightly alkaline
liquid medium, and in twenty-four hours a powdery growth
will occur in such broth. On potato there is apparently no
growth. It rapidly loses its virulence on solid media, and
is said to be non-virulent after three or four sub-culturings.
A temperature of 54&ndash;58&deg;&nbsp;C. for a few minutes kills the bacteria,
but not the toxin. This, however, is removed by
filtration, and is therefore probably intracellular. It is
attenuated by heating to 70&deg;&nbsp;C.</p>

<p>Fraenkel's diplococcus occurs, then, in the acute stage of
pneumonia, in company with streptococci and staphylococci.
It also occurs in the blood in certain suppurative conditions,
in pleurisy and inflammation of the pericardium, and sometimes
in diphtheria, and therefore it is not peculiar to pneumonia.</p>

<p>There is one other point to which attention should be
drawn. Fraenkel's organism is said to be frequently present
in the saliva of healthy persons. Pneumonia depresses
the resistant vitality of the tissues, and thus affords to the
diplococcus present in the saliva an excellent nidus for its
growth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span></p>

<p><em>Friedländer's Pneumo-bacillus</em> is a capsulated oval coccus,
assuming the form of a small bacillus. It is inconstant in
pneumonia, unequally distributed, and scarce; it is aërobic,
and facultatively anaërobic; it occasionally occurs in long
forms and filaments; it is non-motile, non-liquefying, and
has no spores; it does not stain by Gram's method, which
stain is therefore used for differential diagnosis; it will grow
fairly well in ordinary gelatine at 20&deg;&nbsp;C.; and it is a denitrifying
organism, and also an actively fermentative one, even
fermenting glycerine. It is not unlike <em>Bacillus coli communis</em>,
and to distinguish it from that organism we may
remember that the <em>B. coli</em> is motile, never has a capsule,
produces indol, and does not ferment glycerine.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 200px;">
<img src="images/i_b_315.jpg" width="200" height="168" alt="Bacillus of Influenza" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Bacillus of Influenza</span></p></div>

<p><b>Influenza.</b> In 1892, during the pandemic of influenza,
Pfeiffer discovered a bacillus in the bronchial mucus of
patients suffering from the disease. It is one of the smallest
bacilli known, and frequently occurs in chains not unlike
a streptococcus. Carron obtained the same organism from
the blood. In the bronchial expectoration it can retain its
virulence for as long as a fortnight, but it is quickly destroyed
by drying. The bacillus is aërobic, non-motile, and
up to the present spores have not been found. It grows
somewhat feebly in artificial media, and readily dies out.
Blood serum, glycerine agar, broth, and gelatine have all
been used at blood-heat. It does not grow at room tem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>perature.
Pfeiffer's bacillus appears most abundantly at
the height of the disease, and disappears with convalescence.
It is said not to appear in any other disease.</p>

<p><b>Yellow Fever.</b> Sternberg and Havelburg have both
isolated bacilli from cases of yellow fever; but the organism
discovered by Sanarelli, the <em>Bacillus icteroides</em>, is now accepted
as the causal agent of the disease. It is a small,
short rod, with round ends, and generally united in pairs;
it has various pleomorphic forms; it grows well on all the
ordinary media; it is killed in sea-water at 60&deg;&nbsp;C., and also
by direct sunlight in a few hours.</p>

<p><b>Diarrh&oelig;a of Infants.</b> From time to time different
organisms have been isolated in this diseased condition.
<em>Bacillus coli</em> and <em>B. enteriditis sporogenes</em> (Klein) have been
held responsible for it. W. D. Booker, of Johns Hopkins
University, sums up an extended research into the question
as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"No single micro-organism is found to be the specific exciter
of the summer diarrh&oelig;a of infants, but the affection is generally
to be attributed to the result of the activity of a number of
varieties of bacteria, some of which belong to well-known species,
and are of ordinary occurrence and wide distribution, the most
important being the streptococcus and <em>Proteus vulgaris</em>.</p>

<p>"The first step in the pathological process is probably an injury
to the epithelium from abnormal or excessive fermentation, from
toxic products of bacteria, or from other factors.</p>

<p>"Bacteria exert a direct injury upon the tissues in some instances,
whereas in others the damage is brought about indirectly
through the production of soluble poisons."</p></div>

<p><b>Actinomycosis.</b> This disease affects both animals and
man. As Professor Crookshank points out, it has long been
known in this country,<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> but its various manifestations have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>been mistaken for other diseases or have received popular
names.</p>

<p>Here we can only mention the most outstanding facts
concerning the disease. It is caused by the "ray fungus,"
or <em>Streptothrix actinomyces</em>, which, growing on certain
cereals, often gains entrance to the tissues of man and beast
by lacerations of the mucous membrane of the mouth, by
wounds, or by decayed teeth. Barley has been the cereal
in question in some cases. The result of the introduction
of the parasite is what is termed an "infective granuloma."
This is, generally speaking, of the nature of an inflammatory
tumour composed of round cells, epithelioid cells, giant
cells, and fibrous tissue, forming nodules of varying sizes.
In some cases they develop to large tumours, in others they
soon break down. Actinomycosis in some ways closely
resembles tuberculosis in its tissue characters.</p>

<p>In the discharge or pus from human cases of the disease
small sulphur-yellow bodies may be detected, and these are
tufts of "_clubs_" which are the broken-down rays of the
parasite; for in the tissues which are affected the parasite
arranges itself in a radiate manner, growing and extending
at its outer margin and degenerating behind. In cattle the
centre of the old ray becomes caseated, like cheese, or even
calcified, like a stone. In the human disease abundant
"_threads_" are formed as a tangled mass in the middle of
the colony. As clubs characterise the bovine actinomycosis,
so threads are a feature of the human form of the
disease. But in both there is a third element, namely,
<em>small round cells</em>, called by some spores, by others simply
cocci. Authorities are not yet agreed as to the precise
significance and rôle of these round cells. The life-history
of the micro-organism may be summed up thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The spores sprout into excessively fine, straight or sinuous,
and sometimes distinctly spirilliform threads, which branch irreg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>ularly
and sometimes dichotomously. The extremities of the
branches develop the club-shaped bodies. The clubs are closely
packed together, so that a more or less globular body is formed,
with a central core composed of a dense mass of threads"
(Crookshank).</p></div>

<p>Possibly these clubs represent organs of fructification, and
produce the spores. These latter are, it is believed, set free
in the vicinity of the ray, and create fresh centres of disease.</p>

<p>In <em>man</em> the disease manifests itself in various parts according
to the locality of entrance. When occurring in the
mouth it attacks the lower jaw most frequently. In one
recorded case the disease was localised to the bronchi, and
did not even extend into the lungs. It was probably contracted
by inhalation of the parasite. The disease may
spread to distant parts by means of the blood stream,
and frequently the abscesses are apt to burrow in various
directions.</p>

<p>In the <em>ox</em> the disease remains much more localised, and
frequently occurs in the lower jaw, palate, or tongue. In
the last site it is known as "wooden tongue," owing to
the hardness resulting. The skin and subcutaneous tissues
are also a favourite seat of the disease, producing the so-called
wens or clyers so commonly seen in the fen country
(Crookshank). Actinomycosis in cattle is specially prevalent
in river valleys, marshes, and on land reclaimed from
the sea. The disease occurs at all seasons, but perhaps
more commonly in autumn and winter. It is more frequently
met with in young animals. The disease is probably
not hereditary nor readily communicated from animal
to animal.</p>

<p>Actinomyces may be cultivated, like other parasitic diseases,
outside the body. Gelatine, blood serum, agar,
glycerine agar, and potato have been used for this purpose.
After a few days on glycerine agar at the temperature of
the blood little white shining colonies appear, which in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>crease
and coalesce. In about ten days' time the culture
often turns a bright yellow, though it may remain white or
even take on a brown or olive tint. The entire mass of
growth is raised dry and crinkled, and composed almost
exclusively of threads. In its early stage small bacillary
forms occur, and in its later stage coccal forms. True clubs
never occur in pure cultures, although the threads may
occasionally show bulbous endings.</p>

<p><b>Glanders</b> in the horse and ass, and sometimes by communication
in man also, is caused by a short, non-motile,
aërobic bacillus, named, after the old Roman nomenclature
(<em>malleus</em>), <em>Bacillus mallei</em>. It was discovered in 1882 by
Löffler and Schütz. It is found in the nasal discharge of
glandered animals. In appearance the bacillus is not unlike
<em>B. tuberculosis</em>, except that it is shorter and thicker. The
beading of the bacillus of glanders, like that in tubercle,
does not denote spores. <em>B. mallei</em> can be cultivated on the
usual media, especially on glycerine agar and potato. On
the latter medium it forms a very characteristic honey-like
growth, which later becomes reddish-brown.</p>

<p>In the horse glanders particularly affects the nasal mucous
membrane, forming nodules which degenerate and emit an
offensive discharge. From the nose, or nasal septum, as a
centre, the disease spreads to surrounding parts. It may
also occur as nodules in and under the skin, when it is known
as "farcy." Persons attending a glandered animal may
contract the disease, often by direct inoculation.</p>

<p><em>Mallein</em> is a substance analogous to tuberculin, and is
made by growing a pure culture of <em>Bacillus mallei</em> in glycerine-veal
broth in flat flasks, with free access of calcined air.
After a month's growth the culture is sterilised, filtered,
concentrated, and mixed with an equal volume of a .5 per
cent. solution of carbolic. The dose is 1 cc., and it is used,
like tuberculin, for diagnostic purposes. If the suspected
animal reacts to the injection, it is suffering from glanders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
Reaction is judged by three signs, namely, a rise of temperature
2&ndash;3&deg;&nbsp;C., a large "soup-plate" swelling at the site
of inoculation, and an enlargement of the lymphatic
glands.</p>

<p><em>Swine fever</em>, <em>foot-and-mouth disease</em>, <em>chicken cholera</em>, <em>dysentery</em>,
<em>rinderpest</em>, and other diseases of animals have micro-organisms
intimately related to them.</p>

<p>There is a group of diseases due to the presence in the
blood or tissues of <em>h&aelig;matozoa</em>, that is, protozoa which can
live and perform their function in the blood. Amongst
these are malaria, sleeping sickness, and other tropical diseases
in man, and surra and various h&aelig;matozoa in horses,
fish, frogs, or rats.</p>

<p><em>Malaria.</em> Although a <em>Bacillus malari&aelig;</em> has been described
as the cause of this disease, it is now almost universally
supposed that the true cause is a protozoan parasite.
In 1880 Laveran first described this organism, and the
discovery was confirmed by Marchiafava, Celli, and others.
Laveran claimed that it occurred in four different forms
during the progress of its life-history:</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) <em>Spherical or Irregular Bodies</em> attached to the blood
corpuscle, or free in the blood plasma. They are a little
smaller than the blood-cells, and may or may not contain
pigment. They eventually invade the corpuscles, possess
more pigment, and lose their am&oelig;boid movement. Within
the red blood corpuscles they increase in size until they reach
the adult stage.</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) <em>Segmentation Forms</em>, often assuming a rosette shape,
follow next. They are pigmented, are possibly a sporing
stage, and are finally set free in the blood.</p>

<p>(<em>c</em>) <em>The Crescents</em>, or <em>Semilunar Bodies</em>, are free in the
blood, but motionless. They are colourless, have a distinct
membrane, and generally show a little pigment about the
middle; they taper towards the poles. They appear in the
blood after the fever has existed for some time, occurring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
chiefly, sometimes only, in the quotidian and malignant
types of malaria.</p>

<p>(<em>d</em>) <em>The Flagellated Bodies</em> apparently occur only in the
blood outside the body. They are extracorpuscular bodies,
and possess several long flagella, and are therefore actively
motile. They are derived from the crescents or irregular
intracorpuscular bodies.</p>

<p>What is the precise significance of these various forms
and modifications of them is not at present known. Possibly
the semilune is a resting stage inside the body, and
the flagellated body another similar stage outside. Attempts
to cultivate the parasite outside the body have failed.
There is a good deal of evidence to show that the mosquito
is the host outside the human body. There may be different
forms and varieties of parasite, if not actually different
species, causing the diverse forms of clinical malaria.</p>

<p>The above account of diseases caused by bacteria does
not profess to be in any sense exhaustive. It is merely
illustrative. It reveals some of the disease-producing powers
of micro-organisms. There are a large number of other
diseases in which bacteria have been found. They are not
the causes, but only accidentally present or associated with
"secondary infection." Variola (small-pox), scarlet fever,
and measles are excellent examples. It is possible that the
danger at the present time is rather in the direction of supposing
that every disease will readily yield its secret to the
bacteriologist. Such, of course, is not the case. Nevertheless,
as in the past, so in the future, constant research
and patient investigation is the only hope we have for the
elucidation of truth in respect to the causes of disease.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br /><br />

<small><em>DISINFECTION</em></small></h2>

<p>The object of modern bacteriology is not merely to accumulate
tested facts of knowledge, nor only to learn
the truth respecting the biology and life-history of bacteria.
These are most important things from a scientific point of
view. But they are also a means to an end; that end is the
prevention of preventable diseases and the treatment of any
departure from health. In a science not a quarter of a
century old much has already been accomplished in this
direction. The knowledge acquired of, and the secrets
learned from, these tiny vegetable cells which have such
potentiality for good or evil have been, in some degree,
turned against them. When we know what favours their
growth and vitality and virulence, we know something of
the physical conditions which are inimical to their life;
when we know how to grow them, we also know how to
kill them.</p>

<p>We have previously made a cursory examination of the
methods which are adopted for opposing bacteria and their
products in the tissues and body fluids. We must now
turn to consider shortly the modes which may be adopted
in preventive medicine for opposing bacteria outside the
body.</p>

<p>It will be clear at once that we may have varying
degrees of opposition to bacteria. Some substances kill
bacteria, and they are known as <em>germicides</em>; other substances
prevent their development and resulting septic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
action, and these are termed <em>antiseptics</em>. The word <em>disinfectant</em>
is used more or less indiscriminately to cover both
these terms. A <em>deodorant</em> is, of course, a substance removing
the odour of evil-smelling putrefactive processes. Here,
then, we have the common designations of substances able
to act injuriously on bacteria and their products outside, or
upon the surface of, the body. But a moment's reflection
will bring to our minds two facts not to be forgotten. In
the first place, an antiseptic applied in very strong dose, or
for an extended period, may act as a germicide; and, <em>vice
versâ</em>, a germicide in too weak solution to act as such may
perform only the function of an antiseptic. Moreover, the
action of these disinfecting substances not only varies according
to their own strength and mode of application, but
it varies also according to the specific resistance of the protoplasm
of the bacteria in question. Examples of the latter
are abundant, and readers who have only assimilated the
simple facts set forth in these pages are aware that between
the bacillus of diphtheria and the spores of anthrax there
is an enormous difference in power of resistance. In the
second place, reflection will enable us to recall what has
already been said, when discussing the requirements necessary
for bacterial growth, respecting the physical conditions
injurious to development. In a <em>cold temperature</em>, as a general
rule, bacteria do not multiply with the same rapidity as
at blood-heat. Within the limits of a <em>moist perimeter</em> the air
is, to all intents and purposes, germ-free. Direct <em>sunlight</em>
has a definitely germicidal effect in the course of time upon
some of the most virulent bacteria we know. Here, then,
are three examples of physical agents&mdash;low temperature,
moist perimeter, sunlight&mdash;which, if strong enough in degree,
or acting for a long enough period of time, become
first antiseptics and then germicides. Yet for a limited
period they have no injurious effect upon bacteria. These
are simple points, and call for little comment, yet the pages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
of medical and sanitary journals reveal not a few keen controversies
upon the injurious action of certain substances
upon certain bacteria owing to the discrepancies, of necessity
arising, between results of different skilled observers
who have been carrying out different experiments with different
solutions of the same substance upon different protoplasms
of the same species of bacteria. We feel no doubt
that in these pioneering researches much labour has been to
some extent misspent, owing to the neglect of a common
denominator. Only a more accurate knowledge of bacteria
or a recognised standard for disinfecting experiments can
ever supply such common denominator.</p>

<p>Species of bacteria for comparative observation-experiments
upon the action of chemical or physical agents must
be not only the same species, but cultured under the same
conditions, and treated by the agent in the same manner,
otherwise the results cannot be compared upon a common
platform, or with any hope of arriving at exactly the same
conclusions.</p>

<p>Sir George Buchanan laid down, in 1884, a very simple and
suitable standard of what true disinfection meant, viz., the
<em>destruction of the most stable known infective matter</em>. Such
a test is high and difficult to attain unto; nevertheless, it
is the only satisfactory one. Obviously many substances
which are useful antiseptics in practical life would fall far
short of such a standard, yet for true and complete disinfection
such an ideal is the only adequate one.</p>

<p>Quite recently three or four workers at Leipzig<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> have
drawn up simple directions, the adoption of which would
considerably assist in securing a common standard for disinfectant
research. They are as follows:</p>

<p>1. In all comparative observations it is imperative that
<em>molecularly equivalent</em> quantities of the reagents should be
employed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span></p>
<p>2. The bacteria serving as test objects should have equal
power of resistance.</p>

<p>3. The numbers of bacteria used in comparative observation
should be approximately equal.</p>

<p>4. The disinfecting solution must be always used at the
same temperature in comparative experiments.</p>

<p>5. The bacteria must be brought into contact with the
disinfectant with as little as possible of the nutrient material
carried over. (This obviously will depend upon the object
of the research.)</p>

<p>6. After having been exposed to the disinfectant for a
fixed time, they should be freed from it as far as possible.</p>

<p>7. They should then be returned in equal numbers to the
respective culture medium most favourable to the development
of each, and kept at the same, preferably the optimum,
temperature for their growth.</p>

<p>8. The number of surviving bacteria capable of giving
rise to colonies in solid media must be estimated after the
lapse of equal periods of time.</p>

<p>We may now turn from general principles to mention
shortly some of the commoner methods and substances
adopted to secure efficient disinfection. They are all divisible,
according to Sir George Buchanan's standard, into two
groups:</p>

<p>1. Heat in various forms;</p>

<p>2. Chemical bodies in various forms.</p>

<p>It should at the outset be understood that we desire in
practical disinfection to inhibit or kill micro-organisms without
injury to, or destruction of, the substance harbouring
the germs for the time being. If this latter is of no moment,
as in rags or carcasses, burning is the simplest and
most thorough treatment. But with mattresses and beddings,
bedclothes and garments, as well as with the human
body, it is obvious that something short of burning is
required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span></p>

<p>1. From the earliest days of bacteriology heat has held a
prominent place as a disinfector. But it is only in comparatively
recent times that it has been fully established
that <em>moist heat</em> is the only really efficient form of heat disinfection.
Boiling at atmospheric pressure (100&deg;&nbsp;C.) is the
oldest form of moist heat disinfection, and because of the
simplicity of its application it has gained a large degree of
popularity. But it must not be forgotten that mere boiling
(100&deg;&nbsp;C.) may not effectually remove the spores of all bacilli.
Besides, boiling is not applicable to furniture, mattresses,
and such-like frequently infected objects. For many of
these <em>hot-air ovens</em> were used in the early days. But it was
found that such disinfection was no disinfection at all, for
not only did it leave many organisms and spores untouched,
but the degree of temperature was rarely, if ever, uniform
throughout the substance being treated.</p>

<p>The failures following in the track of these methods were
an indication of the need of some form of moist heat, viz.,
steam.</p>

<p>Here it will be necessary to digress for a moment into
some of the characters of steam. When water is heated
certain molecular changes take place, and at a certain temperature
(100&deg;&nbsp;C., 212&deg;&nbsp;F.) the water becomes steam, or
<em>vapour</em>, and on very little cooling will condense. But if the
vapour is heated, it will become practically a gas, and will
not condense until it has lost the whole of the heat, <em>i. e.</em>,
the heat of making water into vapour plus the heat of
making vapour into gas. A gas proper is, then, the vapour
of a liquid of which the boiling-point is substantially below
its actual temperature. But we know that the temperature
at which it boils depends upon the pressure to which it
is subjected (Regnault's law). Hence in reality "steam
at any temperature whatever may be a vapour proper,
provided the pressure is such as prevents the liquid from
boiling below that temperature." In such a condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
of vapour it is termed <em>saturated steam</em>. But if it is at that
same pressure further heated, it becomes practically a gas,
and is called <em>superheated steam</em>. The former can condense
without cooling; the latter cannot so condense at the same
pressure. Saturated steam condenses immediately it meets
the object to be disinfected, and gives out its latent heat;
superheated steam acts by conduction, and not uniformly
throughout the object. Its advantage is that it dries moistened
objects. As a disinfecting power, superheated steam
is much less than saturated steam. There is one further
term which must be defined, namely, <em>current steam</em>. This
is steam escaping from a disinfector as fast as it is admitted,
and may be at atmospheric or higher temperatures. The
disinfecting temperature which is now used as a standard is
<em>an exposure to saturated steam of 115&deg;&nbsp;C. for fifteen minutes</em>.</p>

<p>A number of different kinds of apparatus have been invented
to facilitate disinfection to this standard on a large
scale. Most sanitary authorities of importance are now
supplied with some form of steam disinfector, though many
are unable to go to the expense of high-pressure disinfectors.
Professor Delépine has pointed out<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> that a current of steam
at low pressure may completely disinfect. Whilst such
simple current-steam machines have thus been demonstrated
as efficient bactericides, for all practical purposes it is important
to have disinfectors capable of giving temperatures
considerably above 100&deg;&nbsp;C., of simple construction, having
steam power of uniform temperature and rapid penetration,
and containing, when in action, a minimum of superheated
steam. In addition to these characters of a first-rate steam
disinfector, two other important points should be borne in
mind, namely, the air must be completely ejected from the
disinfection chamber before the results due to steam are
obtained, and some sort of automatic index giving a record
of each disinfection is indispensable.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span></p>
<p>We may turn from these general principles to mention
shortly some of the types of steam disinfectors most commonly
in use. They are four, namely, the Washington
Lyon, the Equifex (Defries), the Thresh, and the Reck.</p>

<p><em>Washington Lyon's</em> apparatus consists of an elongated
boiler having double walls, with a door at each end. The
body of the apparatus is jacketed. The whole is large
enough to admit of bedding and mattresses, and generally
is so arranged that one end opens into one room, and the
other end opens into another room. This convenient position
admits of inserting infected articles from one room and
receiving them disinfected into the other room. Possible
reinfection is thereby prevented. Steam is admitted into
the jacket at a pressure of between twenty and twenty-five
pounds, and is generally twenty pounds in the interior of
the cylinder. At the end of the operation a partial vacuum
is created, by which means much of the moisture on the
articles may be removed. In some cases a current of warm
air is admitted before disinfection in order to diminish the
extent of condensation.</p>

<p>The <em>Equifex</em> (Defries) contains no steam jacket, but coils
of pipes are placed at the top and bottom of the apparatus,
with the object of imparting to the steam as much heat as
is lost by radiation through the walls of the disinfecting
chamber, and at the same time of preventing undue condensation.
The air is first removed by a preliminary current
of steam, after which steam at a pressure of ten pounds
is intermittently introduced and allowed to escape. The
object of this proceeding is to remove air from the pores of
the articles to be disinfected by the sudden expansion of the
film of water previously condensed on their surface. The
apparatus introduced by <em>Dr. Thresh</em> was constructed with a
view of overcoming the objection to some of the other
machines that bulky articles retained a large percentage of
moisture, thus necessitating the use of some additional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
drying apparatus. A central chamber receives the articles
to be disinfected, and is surrounded by a boiler containing
a solution of calcium chloride at a temperature of 225&deg;&nbsp;F.
This is heated by a small furnace, and the steam given off
(218&ndash;300&deg;&nbsp;F.) is conducted into the central chamber. The
steam is not confined under any pressure except that of the
atmosphere. When the steam has passed for a sufficient
length of time, it is readily diverted into the open air. Hot
air is now introduced, and at the expiration of an hour the
articles may be taken out disinfected and as dry as they were
when inserted. The apparatus is comparatively inexpensive,
and not of a complicated nature. The current steam
is saturated, and at a temperature a few degrees above the
boiling-point. Many experiments have been performed
with this apparatus, and there is now a large amount of
evidence in favour of it and current steam disinfection.</p>

<p><em>Reck's</em> apparatus is another kind of saturated steam disinfector,
which resembles the Equifex, but differs from it in
employing steam as a current.</p>

<p>It is probable that many other forms of steam disinfector
will be invented, and each will have its enthusiastic supporters.
Even at the time of writing some excellent results
are announced from America.</p>

<p>2. The effects of <em>chemical substances</em> as solutions, or in
spray form, upon bacteria have been observed from the
earliest days of bacteriology. To some decomposing matter
or solution a disinfectant was added and sub-cultures made.
If bacteria continued to develop, the disinfection had not
been efficient; if, on the other hand, the sub-culture remained
sterile, disinfection had been complete. From such
rough-and-ready methods large deductions were drawn, and
it is hardly too much to say that no branch of bacteriology
contains such a vast mass of unassimilated and unassimilable
statements as that relating to research into disinfectants.
Most of the tabulated and recorded results are conspicuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
in having no standard as regards bacterial growth. Yet
without such a standard results are not comparable.</p>

<p>Silk threads, impregnated with anthrax spores, were
placed in bottles containing carbolic acid of various
strengths, and at stated periods threads were removed and
placed in nutrient media, and development or otherwise
observed. But, as Professor Crookshank<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> has pointed out,
this method is fallacious, the thread being still wet with the
solution when transferred to the medium, and thus modified
in culture, possibly even inhibited altogether. It is
unnecessary for us here to discuss every mode adopted by
investigators in similar researches. We may just mention
that the most approved methods at the present time are
based upon two simple plans of exposure. In one we use a
known volume of recent broth culture of an organism grown
under specified conditions. To this is added a measured
quantity of the antiseptic. At stated periods loopfuls of
the broth and antiseptic mixture are sub-cultured in fresh-sterilised
broth, and resulting development or otherwise
closely observed. The other method is practicable when
we are dealing with volatile bodies. In such cases a standard
culture is made of the organism in broth at a standard
temperature. Into this are dipped small strips of sterilised
linen. When thoroughly impregnated these are removed
from the broth and subsequently dried over sulphuric acid
in a vacuum at 38&deg;&nbsp;C. These may now be exposed for a
longer or shorter period to the fumes of the antiseptic in
question, and broth cultures made at the end of the exposure.
It is obvious that a very large number of modifications
are possible of these two simple devices for testing the bactericidal
power of chemical substances. It should be remembered
that here, perhaps, more than anywhere else in
bacteriological research, careful control experiments are
absolutely necessary.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span></p>
<p><em>Mineral acids</em> (nitric, hydrochloric, sulphuric), especially
concentrated, are all germicides.</p>

<p>The <em>halogens</em>&mdash;chlorine, bromine, iodine, and fluorine&mdash;are,
all four, disinfectants, but not used in practice. They
are named in their order of power as such.</p>

<p>A number of separate bodies, such as <em>chloroform</em> and
<em>iodoform</em>, have been much advocated as antiseptics. The
cost of the former and odour of the latter have, however,
greatly militated against their general adoption.</p>

<p><em>Chloride of lime</em> is a powerful disinfectant. Professor
Sheridan Delépine and Dr. Arthur Ransome have demonstrated
its germicidal effect as a solution applied directly to
the walls of rooms inhabited by tuberculous patients.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> It
may also be used in solid form for dusting decomposing
matter.</p>

<p><em>Mercuric chloride</em> (corrosive sublimate) has been an accepted
germicide for some time. But the experiments of
Behring, Crookshank, and others have proved that the
weaker solutions cannot be relied upon. This is, in part,
due to the fact that it forms in albuminous liquids an albuminate
of mercury which is inactive. Dilute solutions have
the further disadvantage of being unstable. Various authorities
recommend a solution of 1&ndash;500 as a germicide, and
much weaker solutions are, of course, antiseptic. An ounce
each of corrosive sublimate and hydrochloric acid in three
gallons of water makes an efficient disinfectant.</p>

<p><em>Potassium permanganate</em> is, of course, the chief substance
in Condy's fluid, as <em>zinc chloride</em> is in Burnett's disinfecting
fluid. A 5 per cent. of the former and a 2-1/2 per cent. of the
latter are germicidal.</p>

<p><em>Boracic acid</em> is one of the most useful antiseptics with
which to wash sore eyes, or preserve tinned foods or milk. It
is not a strong germicide, but an unirritating and effective
wash. Many cases of its addition to milk have found their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
way into the law courts, owing to cumulative poisoning, and
it should only be used with the very greatest care as a food
preservative.</p>

<p><em>Carbolic acid</em> has come into prominence as an antiseptic
since its adoption by Lister in antiseptic surgery. It is
cheap, volatile, and effective. One part in 400 is antiseptic,
and 1 in 20 germicidal. As a wash for the hands the former
is used, and a weaker solution for the body generally. Carbolic
soap and similar toilet combinations are now very
common. At one time it appeared as if corrosive sublimate
would oust carbolic from the first place as an antiseptic
solution, but a large number of experiments have confirmed
opinion in favour of carbolic. Professor Crookshank found
that carbolic acid, 1 in 40, acting for only one minute is
sufficient to destroy <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em>, <em>S. erysipelatis</em>,
and <em>Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus</em>, and in the strength of 1
in 20 carbolic acid completely sterilised tubercular sputum
when shaken up with it for one minute.</p>

<p><em>Creosol</em>, a member of the phenol series, is a good disinfectant,
and the active element in lysol, Jeye's fluid, creoline,
izal, and creosote.</p>

<p><em>Sulphurous acid</em> is one of the commonest disinfectants
employed for fumigation&mdash;the old orthodox method of disinfecting
a room in which a case of infective disease has
been nursed. It is evolved, of course, by burning sulphur.
For each thousand cubic feet from one to five pounds of
sulphur is used, and the walls may be washed with carbolic
acid. Dr. Kenwood carried out some experiments
in 1896<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> which appear to support the disinfecting power
of sulphur fumes. He found that the <em>Bacillus diphtheri&aelig;</em>
was not killed, though markedly inhibited, when the sulphurous
gas (SO<sub>2</sub>) did not much exceed .25 per cent.
But the bacillus was killed where the sulphur fumes exceeded
.5 per cent. Both these results had reference to the</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span></p>
<p>SO<sub>2</sub> in the air in the centre of the room at a height of four
feet, and after the lapse of four hours. There can be little
doubt that fuming a sealed-up room with sulphur fumes in
a moist atmosphere, and leaving it thus for twenty-four
hours, is generally, if not always, efficient disinfection. It
will kill the bacillus of diphtheria, though not always more
resistant germs. Moreover, its simplicity of adoption is
greatly in its favour. Anyone can readily apply it by purchasing
a few pounds weight of ordinary roll sulphur and
burning this in a saucer in the middle of a room which has
had all its crevices and cracks in windows and walls blocked
up with pasted paper. <em>Nitrous fumes</em> may also be used in
this way.</p>

<p>Recently <em>formalin</em> has come much in favour as a room
disinfectant. Formalin is a 40 per cent. solution of formaldehyde
in water, a gas discovered by Hofmann in 1869.
This gas is a product of imperfect oxidation of methyl
alcohol, and may be obtained by passing vapour of methyl
alcohol, mixed with air, over a glowing platinum wire or
other heated metals, such as copper and silver. It is the
simplest of a series of aldehydes, the highest of which is
palmitic aldehyde. Its formula is CH<sub>2</sub>O, and it is a colourless
gas with a pungent odour, and having penetrating and
irritating properties, particularly affecting the nasal mucous
membrane and the eyes of those working with it. It is
readily soluble in water, and in the air oxidises into formic
acid (CH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). This latter substance occurs in the stings
of bees, wasps, nettles, and various poisonous animal secretions.
Formalin is a strong bactericide even in dilute
solutions, and, of course, volatile. A solution of 1 to
10,000 is said to be able to destroy the bacilli of typhoid,
cholera, and anthrax. A teaspoonful to ten gallons of milk
is said to retard souring. When formalin is evaporated
down, a white residue is left known as paraform. In lozenge
form this latter body is used by combustion of methylated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
spirit to produce the gas. Hence we have three common
forms of the same thing&mdash;<em>formalin</em>, <em>formic aldehyde</em>, <em>paraform</em>&mdash;each
of which yields <em>formic acid</em>, and thus disinfects.
The vapour cannot in practice be generated from the formalin
as readily as from the paraform.</p>

<p>By a variety of ingenious arrangements formic aldehyde
has been tested by a large number of observers during the
last two or three years. We may refer to three modes of
application. 1. <em>The sprayer</em> (Equifex apparatus) produces
a mixture of air and solution for spraying walls, ceilings,
floors, and sometimes garments. 2. <em>The autoclave</em> (Trillat's
apparatus). In this a mixture of a 30&ndash;40 per cent. watery
solution of formaldehyde and calcium chloride (4&ndash;5 per
cent.) is heated under a pressure of three or four atmospheres,
and the almost pure, dry gas is conducted through
a tube passing through the keyhole of the door into the
sealed-up room. 3. <em>The paraform lamp</em> (the Alformant).
The principle of this lamp is that the hot, moist products
from the combustion of methylated spirit act upon the paraform
tablets, converting them into gas. Most of the conclusions
derived from experiments with these three different
forms of apparatus are the same. It is agreed that the gas
is harmless to colours and metal and polished wood. The
vapour acts best in a warm atmosphere. As for its action
on bacteria, it compares favourably with any other disinfectant.
In 1 per cent. solution formalin destroys non-spore-bearing
bacteria in thirty to sixty minutes.</p>

<p>Many observers have decried formaldehyde on account of
its professed lack of penetrating power. Professor Delépine,
however, states<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> that it possesses "penetration powers probably
greater than those of most other active gaseous disinfectants.
<em>Bacillus coli</em>, <em>B. tuberculosis</em>, <em>B. pyocyaneus</em>, and
<em>Staph. pyogenes aureus</em> were killed in dry or moist state,
even when protected by three layers of filter paper." In</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span></p>
<p>Professor Delépine's opinion, the vapours of phenol, izal,
dry chlorine, and sulphurous acid have, under the same
conditions, given inferior results.</p>

<p>We may now shortly summarise the foregoing facts respecting
antiseptics and disinfection in the simplest terms
possible to afford facility to the uninitiated in practical
application:</p>

<p><em>To disinfect a room</em>, seal up cracks and crevices, and burn
at least one pound of roll sulphur for every 1,000 cubic feet
of space.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> Many authorities recommend four or five pounds
of sulphur to the same space. Let the room remain sealed
up for twenty-four hours.</p>

<p><em>To disinfect walls</em>, wash with chloride of lime solution
(1&ndash;100) or carbolic acid (1&ndash;40). This latter solution may be
used to wipe down furniture. Either or both may be used
<em>after</em> sulphur fuming. Formic aldehyde may also be used
by lamp or autoclave.</p>

<p><em>To disinfect bedding</em>, <em>etc.</em>, the steam sterilisation secured
in a Thresh, Equifex, or Lyon apparatus is the best. Rags
and infected clothing, unless valuable, should be burnt.</p>

<p><em>To disinfect garments and wearing apparel</em>, they should be
washed in a disinfectant solution, or fumed with formic
aldehyde.</p>

<p><em>To disinfect excreta or putrefying solutions</em>, enough disinfectant
should be added to produce <em>in the solution or matter
being disinfected</em> the percentage of disinfectant necessary to
act as such. Adding a small quantity of antiseptic to a
large volume of fluid or solid is as useless as pouring a small
quantity of antiseptic down a sewer with the idea that such
treatment will disinfect the sewage. The mixture of the
disinfectant with the matter to be disinfected must contain
the standard percentage for disinfection. Chloride of lime
is a common substance for use in this way. Potassium
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>permanganate (1&ndash;100) and carbolic (1&ndash;100), and many manufactured
bodies containing them, are also widely used. Drs.
Hill and Abram recommend<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> that the excreta and disinfectant
be thoroughly mixed and stand for at least half an hour.
For various reasons they particularly advise <em>chinosol</em> as the
most convenient disinfectant for this specific purpose.</p>

<p><em>Antiseptics for wounds.</em> Carbolic acid (1&ndash;40) or corrosive
sublimate (1&ndash;1,000) are commonly used in surgical practice.
Boracic acid is one of the most unirritating antiseptics which
are known. It may be used in saturated watery solution
(1&ndash;30) or dusted on copiously as fine powder. It is especially
applicable in open wounds, and as an eye-wash.</p>

<p><em>To disinfect hands and arms.</em> Operating surgeons are
those to whom it is a most urgent necessity to cleanse hands
and arms antiseptically. Carbolic acid (1&ndash;20, or 1&ndash;40) is
used for this purpose.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to add that in a case of infectious
disease occurring in a household many of these modes of
application, perhaps all of them, must be adopted. Formalin
is probably the best gaseous disinfectant which we
have, but its use does not, and should not, preclude the
simultaneous adoption of other methods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX" id="APPENDIX">APPENDIX</a></h2>

<p>It is proposed to add one or two notes on certain technical
points in bacteriological work, with a view to assisting those
medical men not able to obtain the advantages of a well-equipped
laboratory, and yet desirous of occasionally attempting some
practical bacteriology.</p>

<p>1. <em>General Examination.</em> All fluids may be examined for bacteria
in two chief ways:</p>

<p>(<em>a</em>) A small quantity may be placed on a cover-glass or slide,
dried over a lamp or bunsen flame, and stained with aniline dyes
for a few minutes. It is then ready for microscopic examination.
It is obvious that the result will generally be a <em>mixture</em> of bacteria,
for which differentiating stains may be used (Gram, Ziehl-Neelsen,
etc.).</p>

<p>(<em>b</em>) A minute drop of the suspected fluid may be added to
various fluid media (broth, liquefied gelatine, etc.) and then
plated out upon small sterilised sheets of glass. In the course
of two or three days the contained bacteria will reveal themselves
in characteristic colonies, which may be examined, and if possible
sub-cultured, and carefully studied.</p>

<p><em>Double-Staining Methods.</em> These are various, and are used
when it is desired to stain the bacteria themselves one colour,
and the matrix or ground substance in which they are situated
another colour. Three of the commoner methods are those of
Ehrlich, Neelsen, and Gram. They are as follows:</p>

<p><em>Ehrlich's Method.</em> "Five parts of aniline oil are shaken up
with 100 parts distilled water, and the emulsion filtered through
moistened filter paper. A saturated alcoholic solution of fuchsine,
methyl-violet, or gentian-violet is added to the filtrate in a watch-glass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
drop by drop, until precipitation commences. Cover-glass
preparations are floated in this mixture for fifteen to thirty minutes,
then washed for a few seconds in dilute nitric acid (one part nitric
acid to two of water), and then rinsed in distilled water. The
stain is removed from everything except the bacilli; but the
ground substance can be after-stained brown if the bacilli are
violet, or blue if they have been stained red" (Crookshank,
<em>Bacteriology and Infective Diseases</em>, p. 89).</p>

<p><em>Gram's Method.</em> The primary stain in this method is a solution
of aniline gentian-violet (saturated alcoholic solution of
gentian-violet 30 cc., aniline water 100 cc.), which stains both
ground substance and bacteria in purple. The preparation is
next immersed in the following solution for half a minute or a little
more:</p>

<table summary="The preparation" width="50%"><tr>
<td class="tdl">Iodine</td><td class="tdr">1  part&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdl">Potassium iodide</td><td class="tdr">2  parts</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdl">Distilled water</td><td class="tdr">300  parts</td>
</tr></table>

<p>In this short space of time the iodine solution acts as a mordant
of the purple colour in the bacteria, but not in the ground
substance. Hence, if the preparation be now (when it has assumed
a <em>brown</em> colour) washed in alcohol (methylated spirit), the
ground substance slowly loses its colour and becomes clear. But
the bacteria retain their colour, and thus stand out in a well-defined
manner. Cover-glass preparations decolourise more
quickly than sections of hardened tissue, and they should only be
left in the methylated spirit until no more colour comes away.
The preparation may now be washed in water, dried, and
mounted for microscopic examination, or it may be double-stained,
that is, immersed in some contrast colour which will
lightly stain the ground substance. Eosin or Bismarck brown
are commonly used for this purpose. The former is applied for
a minute or two, the latter for five minutes, after which the
specimen is passed through methylated spirit (and preferably
xylol also) and mounted. The result is that the bacteria appear
in a dark purple colour on a background of faint pink or brown.
Carbol-thionine blue, picro-carmine, and other stains are occa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>sionally
used in place of the aniline gentian-violet, and there are
other slight modifications of the method.</p>

<p><em>Ziehl-Neelsen Method.</em> Here the primary stain is a solution of
carbol-fuchsin:</p>

<table summary="The preparation" width="80%"><tr>
<td class="tdl">Fuchsin</td><td class="tdr">1  part&nbsp;&nbsp;</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdl">Absolute alcohol</td><td class="tdr">10 parts</td></tr><tr>
<td class="tdl">5 per cent. aqueous solution of carbolic acid</td><td class="tdr">100 parts</td>
</tr></table>

<p>It is best to heat the dye in a sand-bath, in order to distribute
the heat evenly. The various stages in the staining process are
as follows: (<em>a</em>) The cover-glass with the dried film upon it is
immersed in the hot stain for one to three minutes. (<em>b</em>) Remove
the cover-glass from the carbol-fuchsin, and place it in a capsule
containing a 25 per cent. solution of sulphuric acid to decolourise
it. Here its redness is changed into a slate-grey colour. (<em>c</em>)
Wash in water, and alternately in the acid and water, until it is
of a faint pink colour. (<em>d</em>) Now place the cover-glass for a
minute or two in a saturated aqueous solution of methylene-blue,
which will counter-stain the decolourised ground substance blue.
(<em>e</em>) Wash in water. (<em>f</em>) Dehydrate by rinsing in methylated spirit,
dry, and mount. A pure culture of bacteria will not necessarily
require the counter-stain (methylene-blue). Sections of tissue
may require twenty to thirty minutes in the primary stain (carbol-fuchsin).
This stain is used for tubercle and leprosy. With a
little practice the staining of the bacillus of tubercle when present
in pus or sputum becomes a very simple and accurate method of
diagnosis. A small particle of sputum or pus is placed between
two clean cover-glasses and thus pressed between the thumb and
finger into a thin film. This is readily dried and stained as
above, the bacillus of tubercle appearing as a delicately-beaded
red rod with a background of blue.</p>

<p><em>Bacteriological Diagnosis.</em> The following points must be ascertained
in order to identify any particular micro-organism:</p>

<p>(1) Its morphology, bacillus, coccus, spirillum, etc.; the presence
or absence of involution forms.</p>

<p>(2) Motility by the unstained cover-glass preparation ("hanging
drop"); note presence of flagella.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span></p>

<p>(3) Presence of spores, their appearance and position.</p>

<p>(4) Whether or not the organism stains with Gram's method.</p>

<p>(5) The character of the growth upon various media (gelatine,
agar, milk, potato, broth); the presence or absence of liquefaction
in the gelatine culture; its power of producing acid, gas, or indol.</p>

<p>(6) Whether it is aërobic or anaërobic.</p>

<p>(7) Its colour in cultivation.</p>

<p>(8) If it is a disease-producing organism under examination,
its effect upon the animal tissues and the course of the disease
should be observed.</p>

<p>There are other points of importance, but the above are essential
to a right conclusion.</p>

<p><em>Diagnosis in Special Diseases:</em></p>

<p>(1) <em>Diphtheria.</em> This disease may be bacteriologically diagnosed
with a minimum of apparatus and equipment. By means
of a swab a rubbing from a suspected throat is readily obtained.
This may be examined by the microscope, or sub-cultured on
favourable medium. Blood serum is perhaps the best, but, as
Hewlett remarks, "If no serum tubes can be had, an egg may
be used. It is boiled hard, the shell chipped away from one end
with a knife sterilised by heating, and the inoculation made on
the exposed white surface; the egg is then placed, inoculated end
down, in a wine-glass of such a size that it rests on the rim and
does not touch the bottom. A few drops of water may with advantage
be put at the bottom of the glass to keep the egg-white
moist. The preparation is kept in a warm place for twenty-four
to forty-eight hours and then examined." The examination, of
course, consists in staining and preparing for the microscope and
observing the form, arrangement, and characters of the organism
or organisms present. A small piece of the membrane may be
detached, washed in water, and stained for the bacilli.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Tubercle</em> (Ziehl-Neelsen's stain, <em>vide supra</em>).</p>

<p>(3) <em>Typhoid</em> (<em>Enteric Fever</em>).</p>

<p><em>Widal's Reaction.</em> This diagnostic test depends upon the effect
which the blood of a person suffering from typhoid fever has
upon the <em>Bacillus typhosus</em>. The effect is twofold. In the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
place, the actively motile <em>B. typhosus</em> becomes immotile; and
secondly, there is an agglutination, or grouping together in
colonies, of the <em>B. typhosus</em>. Neither of these features occurs if
healthy human blood is brought into contact with a culture of the
typhoid bacillus. There are various ways in which this "serum
diagnosis" can be carried out. The simplest and quickest
method is as follows: To ten drops of a twenty-four or forty-eight-hours-old
neutral broth culture of the typhoid bacillus one
drop of the blood serum to be tested is added. The serum and
culture are rapidly mixed in the trough of a hollow ground slide
(such as is used for the "hanging drop"), and a single drop is
taken, placed upon an ordinary clean slide, and a cover-glass
superimposed. The positive reaction of agglutination and immotility,
if the blood comes from a case of typhoid fever, will
probably appear within fifteen or twenty minutes. The fluid
culture of typhoid may be taken from an agar culture as well as
from broth. In both cases it may be desirable to filter through
ordinary filter paper to remove any normally agglutinated masses
of bacilli before commencing the test.</p>

<p>In his first experiments Widal used a test-tube in the following
manner: The blood to be tested is diluted by one part of it being
added to fifteen parts of broth in a test-tube. The mixture is
inoculated with a drop of a typical <em>Bacillus typhosus</em> culture.
The tube is then incubated at 37&deg;&nbsp;C. for twenty-four hours, after
which it is examined. If the reaction be positive, the broth appears
comparatively clear, but at the bottom of the test-tube a
more or less abundant sediment will be found. This is due to
the clumps of bacilli having fallen owing to gravity. If, on the
other hand, the reaction is negative, the broth will appear more
or less uniformly turbid.</p>

<p>For the <em>apparatus</em> required to carry out the simpler methods of
bacteriological work reference should be made to the standard
laboratory text-books, which furnish all necessary details. A
good microscope, with a 1/12 oil immersion lens, is, of course, essential.
This can now be obtained for about £16 (Beck, Swift, Baker,
Watson, etc.), and the other necessary apparatus is readily obtainable
of Baird and Tatlock, Hatton Garden, E. C., and other makers.</p>

dry heat and moist heat. Moist heat is able to kill organisms much more readily
than dry, owing to its penetrating effect on the capsule of the bacillus. Dry
heat at 140&deg;&nbsp;C. (284&deg;&nbsp;F.), maintained for three hours, is necessary to kill the
resistant spores of <em>Bacillus anthracis</em> and <em>B. subtilis</em>, but moist heat at fifty
degrees less will have the same effect. It is from data such as these that in
laboratories and in disinfecting apparatus moist heat is invariably preferred to
dry heat. For with the latter such high temperatures would be required that
they would damage the articles being disinfected. Koch states the following
figures for general guidance: Dry heat at a temperature of 120&deg;&nbsp;C. (248&deg;&nbsp;F.)
will destroy spores of mould fungi, micrococci, and bacilli in the absence of
their spores; for the spores of bacilli 140&deg;&nbsp;C. (284&deg;&nbsp;F.), maintained for three
hours, is necessary; moist heat at 100&deg;&nbsp;C. (212&deg;&nbsp;F.) for fifteen minutes will kill
bacilli and their spores.</p></div>

of sewage are precisely analogous to those used in milk research. Dilution
with sterilised water previous to plating out on gelatine in Petri dishes is essential
(1 cc. to 10,000 cc. of sterile water, or some equally considerable dilution),
otherwise the large numbers of germs would rapidly liquefy and destroy the film.
Special methods must be used for the isolation of special organisms; phenol-gelatine,
Elsner medium, indol reaction, "shake" cultures, Parietti broth, etc.,
must often be resorted to for special bacteria. Spores of bacteria may always
be numerically estimated by adding the suspected water or sewage to gelatine,
and then heating to 80&deg;&nbsp;C. for ten minutes before plating out. This temperature
removes the bacilli, but leaves the spores untouched.</p></div>

papers on the subject, draws attention to Müntz's criticism that the nitrifying
organisms only oxidise from nitrogenous matter to nitrites, and not from nitrites
to nitrates. Müntz held that the conversion of nitrite into nitrate is brought
about by the joint action of carbonic acid and oxygen. Professor Warington's
experiments, however, clearly illustrate that the production of nitrates from
nitrites in an ammoniacal solution can be determined by the character of the
bacterial culture with which the solution is seeded, and that in a solution of
potassium nitrite conversion into nitrate can be determined by the introduction
of the nitric organism. Professor Warington still adheres to the opinion, in
favour of which he has produced so much evidence, that the formation of
nitrates in the soil is due to the nitric organism which soil always contains.</p></div>

views held with regard to the formation of antitoxins. It is needless to remark
that the whole matter is one of abstruse technicality and intricacy. These
antitoxic bodies gradually increase in the blood and tissues, and their action
falls into two groups: (<em>a</em>) <em>antitoxic</em>, which counteract the effects of the poison
itself; and (<em>b</em>) <em>antimicrobic</em>, which counteract the effects of the bacillus itself.
"In one and the same animal the blood may contain a substance or substances
which are both antitoxic and antimicrobic, such, for example, as occurs in the
process of the formation of the diphtheria and tetanus antitoxic serums" (Sidney
Martin).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_95" id="Footnote_95"></a><a href="#FNanchor_95"><span class="label">95</span></a> 1. Tuberculosis is a disease mainly affecting the lungs (<em>consumption</em>, <em>decline</em>,
<em>phthisis</em>) of young adults and the bowels of infants (<em>tabes mesenterica</em>). It may
affect any part of the body, and its manifestations are very various. It also
affects animals, particularly cattle, by whom it may be transmitted to man.
</p>
<p>
2. <em>Its direct cause</em> is a microscopic vegetable cell, known as the <em>Bacillus
tuberculosis</em>, discovered by Koch in 1882. This fungus requires to be magnified
some hundreds of times before it can even be seen. When it gains entrance
to the weakened body it sets up the disease, which is an <em>infectious</em> disease,
though different in degree to the infectiousness of, say, measles.
</p>
<p>
3. <em>Trade influence and occupation</em>, in some cases, undoubtedly predispose
the individual to tubercle. Cramped attitudes, exposure to dampness or cold,
ill ventilation, and exposure to inhalation of dust of various kinds, all act in
this way. In support of the evil effect of each of these four conditions much
evidence could he produced.
</p>
<p>
4. <em>Overcrowding</em> has a definite influence in propagating tubercular diseases.
The agricultural counties without big towns, like Worcestershire, Herefordshire,
Buckinghamshire, and Rutland, are the counties having the lowest mortality
from tuberculosis; whilst the crowded populations in Northumberland,
South Wales, Lancashire, London, and the West Riding suffer most. Speaking
more particularly, the overcrowded areas of London, such as St. Giles',
Strand, Holborn, and Central London generally, show very high tubercular
death-rates.
</p>
<p>
5. <em>Tuberculosis is not increasing.</em> During the last thirty years it has shown,
with few exceptions, a steady decline in all parts of England. "Consumption"
is most fatal in comparatively young people (fifteen to forty-five years), whilst
"tabes" and other forms of tubercle are fatal chiefly to young children. These
forms have not declined so much as the lung form. The mortality in consumption
of males has since 1866 been in excess of that of females. The age
of maximum fatality from consumption is <em>later</em> than in the past, which is
probably due to improved hygiene and treatment.
</p>
<p>
6. <em>This decline has been due</em>, not to any special repressive measures&mdash;for few
or none have been carried out&mdash;but to a general and extensive social improvement
in the life of the people, to an increase of knowledge respecting tuberculosis
and hygiene, to an enormous advance in sanitation, and to more efficient
land drainage.
</p>
<p>
7. <em>Not all persons are equally liable to consumption</em>, some being much more
susceptible than others. We have mentioned the predisposing influence of
certain trades. There is also heredity, which acts, as we have said, in transmitting
a tubercular <em>tendency</em>, not commonly the actual virus of the disease;
there is, thirdly, the debilitating effect of previous illness or chronic alcoholism;
there is, fourthly, the habitual breathing of rebreathed air; and, fifthly,
there are the conditions of the environment, like dampness and darkness of the
dwelling. Such influences as these weaken the resisting power of the tissues,
and thus afford a suitable nidus for the bacillus conveyed in milk or by the
inspiration of infected dust.
</p>
<p>
8. <em>Consumption is curable</em> if taken in time. In cases where the lungs are
half gone, and consist of large cavities, it is obvious that curability is out of
the question. But if the disease can be properly treated in its earliest stages,
there is considerable likelihood of recovery.
</p>
<p>
9. <em>The breath is not dangerous</em>, as far as we know, but there is danger from
discharges of any kind from any infected part, whether lungs or bowels; for
such discharges, when dry, may readily pollute the air, and either the bacilli
or spores be inhaled into the lungs.
</p>
<p>
10. <em>The chief channels of personal infection or the spread of the disease
amongst a community</em> are two: (<em>a</em>) dried tubercular sputum (or other tubercular
discharges); (<em>b</em>) infected milk or meat. So long as the former remains wet
or moist, infection cannot take place. It is, of course, better to destroy it
completely. As for milk and meat, boiling the former and thoroughly cooking
the latter will remove all danger.
</p>

<p>
11. <em>The expectoration is infective.</em> This is one of the commonest modes of
infection, and to it is held to be due the large amount of respiratory tuberculosis
(consumption, phthisis). The expectoration from the lungs must contain,
from the nature of the case, a very large number of bacilli. As a matter of
fact, a single consumptive individual can cough up in a day millions of tubercle
bacilli. When expectoration becomes dry, the least current of air will
disseminate the infective dust, which can by that means be readily reinspired.
Expectoration on pavements and floors, as well as on handkerchiefs, may thus become,
on drying, a source of great danger to others. The discharges from the
bowels of infants suffering from the disease also contain the infective material.
</p>
<p>
12. <em>Milk</em>, though a much more likely channel for conveyance of tubercle
than meat, is only or chiefly virulent when the udder is the seat of tuberculous
lesions. The consumption of such milk is only dangerous when it contains a
great number of bacilli and is ingested in considerable quantity. Practically
the danger from using raw milk exists only for those persons who use it as
their sole or principal food, <em>e. g.</em>, young children. All danger is avoided by
boiling or pasteurising the milk.
</p>
<p>
At the same time there is an increasing amount of evidence forthcoming at
the present time which goes to prove that milk is not infrequently tainted with
tubercle (see p. 195). The tuberculin test should be applied to all milch cows,
and the infected ones isolated from the herd. Milk supplies should be more
strictly inspected even than cowsheds.
</p>
<p>
13. There are several methods by which <em>meat infection can be prevented</em>. In
the first place, herds should be kept healthy, and tubercular animals isolated.
Cowsheds and byres should be under sanitary supervision, especially as
regards overcrowding, dampness, lack of light, and uncleanliness. Public
slaughter-houses under a sanitary authority would undoubtedly be most advantageous.
Meat inspection should also be more strictly attended to; efficient
cooking, and avoidance of "roll" meat which has not been thoroughly cooked
in the middle.
</p>
<p>
14. <em>Consumptive patients may diminish their disease.</em> Dr. Arthur Ransome<a name="FNanchor_95a" id="FNanchor_95a"></a><a href="#Footnote_95a" class="fnanchor">95a</a>
has laid down five axioms of hygiene for phthisical patients which, if followed,
would materially improve the condition of such persons. At Davos, St. Moritz,
Nordrach and other places where they have been practised, the beneficial
change has been in many cases extraordinary:
</p>

<p class="indent padl2">(1) Abundance of light, nutritious, easily digested food, which must
comprise a large allowance of fat; small meals, but frequent;
</p>
<p class="indent padl2">
(2) An almost entirely open-air life, with as much sunshine as can be
obtained;
</p>
<p class="indent padl2">
(3) Suitable clothing, mostly wool;
</p>
<p class="indent padl2">
(4) Cleanliness and bracing cold-water treatment;
</p>
<p class="indent padl2">
(5) Mild but regular exercise.
</p>
<p>
15. <em>Consumptive patients may also assist in preventing the spread of the
disease.</em> In the first place, they should follow the hygienic directions just
mentioned, because such conditions fulfilled will materially lessen the contagiousness
of such patients; next, the expectoration must never be allowed to
get dry. A spitting-cup containing a little disinfectant solution (one teaspoonful
of strong carbolic acid to two tablespoonfuls of water) should always be
used, or the expectoration received into paper handkerchiefs which can be
burnt. Spoons, forks, cups, and all such articles should be thoroughly cleaned
before being used by other persons. The patient should not sleep in company
with another, but occupy, if possible, a separate bedroom.
</p>
<p>
Isolation hospitals for consumptives, as for patients suffering from diphtheria,
are now being established.
</p>
<p>
16. <em>House influence</em> has some effect, both directly and indirectly, upon tubercular
diseases. Damp soils, darkness, and small cubic space in the dwelling-house
exert a very prejudicial effect upon tubercular patients. Sir Richard
Thorne<a name="FNanchor_95b" id="FNanchor_95b"></a><a href="#Footnote_95b" class="fnanchor">[95b]</a> has described the favourable house for such persons as one
built upon a soil which is dry naturally or freed by artificial means from the
injurious influences of dampness and of the oscillations of the underlying subsoil.
The house itself should be so constructed as to be protected against
dampness of site, foundations, and walls. Upon at least two opposite sides of
the dwelling-house there should be enough open space to secure ample movement
of air about it, and free exposure to sunlight. Lastly, it should be possible
to have free movement of air by day and night through all habitable
rooms of the house. It is clear that many inhabited houses could not stand to
these tests; but effort should be made to approach as near to such a standard
as possible.
</p>
<p>
17. <em>Sunlight and fresh air</em> are the greatest enemies to infection.
</p>
<p>
18. <em>Disinfection is necessary after death from phthisis</em>, and should be as
complete as after any other infective disease. Compulsory notification of fatal
cases and compulsory disinfection have been officially ordered by the Prussian
Government. In this country also absolute disinfection should always be insisted
upon after phthisis. Walls, floors, carpets, curtains, etc., should be
strictly sterilised. Professor Delépine recommends spraying with 1&ndash;100 solution
of chloride of lime.</p></div>

<p>Edited by Professor <span class="smcap">J. McKeen Cattell</span>, Columbia University,
with the cooperation of <span class="smcap">Frank Evers Beddard</span>,
F.R.S., in Great Britain.</p>
<p>Each volume of the series will treat some department of
science with reference to the most recent advances, and will
be contributed by an author of acknowledged authority.
Every effort will be made to maintain the standard set by the
first volumes, until the series shall represent the more important
aspects of contemporary science. The advance of
science has been so rapid, and its place in modern life has
become so dominant, that it is needful to revise continually
the statement of its results, and to put these in a form that is
intelligible and attractive. The man of science can himself
be a specialist in one department only, yet it is necessary for
him to keep abreast of scientific progress in many directions.
The results of modern science are of use in nearly every profession
and calling, and are an essential part of modern
education and culture. A series of scientific books, such as
has been planned, should be assured of a wide circulation,
and should contribute greatly to the advance and diffusion of
scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>The volumes will be in octavo form, and will be fully illustrated
in so far as the subject-matter calls for illustrations.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
